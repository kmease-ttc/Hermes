Perfect — you’re describing a **single, canonical “Crew Header” pattern**, with **Speedster as the gold standard**, and you want **every crew page (Sentinel, Hemingway, Bacon, etc.) to conform to it exactly**.

Below is a **clean, implementation-ready spec** you can hand straight to the UI/agent/dev layer.

---

## Canonical Crew Header (Gold Standard = Speedster)

This header **must appear at the top of every crew member page**.
No variations. No omissions. No creative interpretations.

---

## 1. Left Section — Identity & Purpose

**Elements (top to bottom):**

1. **Crew Avatar / Icon**

   * Circular
   * Consistent size across all crews
   * Color-coded per crew (existing)

2. **Crew Name (H1)**

   * Example: `Speedster`
   * Large, bold, primary text

3. **Crew Category / Role (Pill)**

   * Example: `Performance Monitoring`
   * Single pill, muted but readable

4. **One-line Description**

   * Example:

     > “Monitors Core Web Vitals and page speed metrics.”
   * This is mandatory for all crew
   * Max 1 line (truncate with tooltip if longer)

---

## 2. Capability Tags (Below Description)

**Purpose:** instantly explain *what this crew actually does*

* Render as pill tags
* Clickable only if they filter content (otherwise static)
* Examples (Speedster):

  * `LCP Tracking`
  * `CLS Tracking`
  * `INP Tracking`
  * `Core Web Vitals`
  * `Page Speed`
  * `Performance Score`

**Rules**

* 3–6 tags max
* Tags must be defined per crew (not auto-generated junk)
* Same visual style across all crew

---

## 3. Right Section — Status & Controls

### A. Agent Score (Required)

* Label: **Score** or **Agent Score**
* Numeric value (e.g. `65`)
* Color-coded:

  * Green = good
  * Yellow = warning
  * Red = critical
* Tooltip:

  * “Overall effectiveness based on recent findings and execution”

### B. Action Buttons (Icon Buttons)

Order (left → right):

1. **Refresh / Re-run**

   * Icon: refresh
   * Re-executes the agent

2. **Export**

   * Icon: external / download
   * Disabled if no data

3. **Settings**

   * Icon: gear
   * Opens crew-specific configuration page

All icon buttons:

* Same size
* Same hover behavior
* No text labels (icons only)

---

## 4. Ask Crew Member (Inline Query Bar)

This is **not optional** — every crew must have it.

**Layout**

* Full-width input under the header
* Placeholder text customized per crew

**Examples**

* Speedster:

  > “Why is LCP slow? What should I fix first?”
* Sentinel:

  > “Which pages are losing traffic? What should be refreshed?”

**Rules**

* Always visible
* Always scoped to *this* crew
* Submits questions to the crew’s reasoning engine
* Purple send button (consistent with Speedster)

---

## 5. Navigation Behavior

* This header **replaces ad-hoc titles** like “Sentinel – Content Decay Monitor”
* No duplicate titles below the header
* The page content (findings, next steps, missions) starts *after* this header

---

## 6. Disabled / Not-Hired State (Important)

If the crew is **not hired**:

* Header still renders (for upsell + education)
* Everything is **visually muted**
* Show **Hire Crew** button in the right-side controls area
* Disable:

  * Ask bar
  * Refresh
  * Export
  * Settings

This keeps consistency while still encouraging activation.

---

## 7. Engineering Implementation (Strong Recommendation)

Create a **single reusable component**:

```
<CrewHeader
  crewId="speedster"
  name="Speedster"
  category="Performance Monitoring"
  description="Monitors Core Web Vitals and page speed metrics."
  tags={[...]}
  score={65}
  enabled={true}
/>
```

Then:

* Remove all custom headers from individual crew pages
* Every crew page imports and uses this component
* Speedster becomes the reference snapshot for regression testing

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

* Speedster, Sentinel, Hemingway, Bacon, etc. all have:

  * Same structure
  * Same spacing
  * Same control placement
* You can switch between crews and the header never “jumps”
* A new crew can be added by **only filling metadata**, not redesigning UI

---

If you want next steps, I can:

* Write the **exact props contract** for the CrewHeader
* Define **default tag sets** for every existing crew
* Create a **before/after checklist** to validate parity with Speedster
* Draft copy for each crew’s description + Ask placeholder

Just tell me which one you want next.
