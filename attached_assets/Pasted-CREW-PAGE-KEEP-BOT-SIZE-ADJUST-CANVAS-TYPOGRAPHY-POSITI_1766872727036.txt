CREW PAGE – KEEP BOT SIZE, ADJUST CANVAS + TYPOGRAPHY + POSITIONS (NO OVERLAP)

Context:
We LOVE the current bot/character size. Do NOT reduce avatar size. The remaining work is:
- expand the ship canvas vertically so other sections move below
- tighten top padding inside tiles slightly
- make all names bigger and consistent sizing
- make tile frames slightly smaller (optional) WITHOUT shrinking avatars
- ensure ALL role slots (filled + empty) fit with ZERO overlap

Non-negotiable:
1) Keep avatar size exactly as-is (do not shrink bots).
2) Remove overlap by adjusting slot positions and canvas height, not by shrinking avatars.
3) The ship area can be taller and the page can scroll; push Active Capabilities + Set Bonuses further down.

---

### A) EXPAND SHIP CANVAS + PUSH LOWER SECTIONS DOWN
- Increase ship canvas container height so all ship bays fit comfortably:
  - min-height: 980px on desktop
  - allow it to grow as needed (page can scroll)
- Move Active Capabilities / Set Bonuses BELOW the ship section (below the fold is fine).
- The ship rectangle should extend down close to where those sections begin.

---

### B) TILE INTERNAL SPACING (LESS TOP GAP)
Inside each tile:
- Reduce top padding above the avatar slightly (so the bot sits a bit higher).
- Keep space for:
  - info icon (top-left)
  - status badge (top-right)
- These must NOT overlap the avatar.

---

### C) NAMES: BIGGER + CONSISTENT
- Increase crew name font size ~20–30%.
- All crew names must be the same font size and style (including Major Tom).
- Names must stay inside the tile (bottom center).
- Use truncation if needed, but avoid wrapping.

Suggested:
- name: text-base or text-lg (depending on tile size)
- weight: semibold
- color: text-primary

---

### D) FRAMES: CAN BE SLIGHTLY SMALLER (OPTIONAL)
If needed to reduce crowding:
- Reduce frame padding/border thickness slightly.
- Keep the avatar visual size unchanged.
- Keep frames square with the same corner radius.

---

### E) NO OVERLAP: ADJUST SLOT COORDINATES
We must eliminate overlap entirely for filled + empty bays.

Rules:
- At >= 1280px width: ZERO overlap.
- Minimum spacing between tile edges:
  - horizontal >= 28px
  - vertical >= 36px
- Major Tom must not overlap the SERP Tracking empty bay.
- Sentinel must not overlap Beacon or bottom bays.
- Bottom bays (AI Optimization, Paid Ads, Knowledge) must remain fully visible and unobstructed.

Implementation:
- Update the xPct/yPct (or grid areas) for each slot to spread them out.
- Use more vertical space; do not compress.

---

### F) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Done when:
- Bot avatars are unchanged in size (same visual scale).
- Names are bigger and uniform across all crew.
- Tiles have slightly less dead space above avatar.
- Ship canvas is taller and lower sections are pushed down.
- All role bays (filled and empty) fit without any overlap.
