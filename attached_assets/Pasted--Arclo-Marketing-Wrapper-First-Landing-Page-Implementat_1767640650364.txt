# Arclo – Marketing Wrapper + First Landing Page Implementation Instructions
Owner: Web Dev Team (Replit)
Goal: Add a conversion-focused marketing wrapper to Arclo and launch the first landing page that drives “Run Free SEO Scan” conversions.

---

## 0) Success Criteria (Definition of Done)
The work is complete when:
1. `GET /` shows a marketing landing page (not the app UI).
2. The landing page has a working URL input + “Run Free SEO Scan” CTA that starts a scan and routes the user into results.
3. A “Preview Results” step shows 1–3 findings without login; full report requires account creation/login.
4. SEO basics are implemented: title/meta, canonical, H1, Open Graph/Twitter tags, robots, sitemap.
5. Analytics event tracking is in place for CTA clicks and funnel steps.
6. Mobile performance is acceptable (no layout shift; fast first paint; minimal JS).

## 1) Information Architecture / Routes
Implement the following routes:

### Public marketing pages
- `/` (Primary landing page)
- `/how-it-works` (optional v1, but stub route okay)
- `/use-cases` (optional v1, stub okay)
- `/privacy` (required)
- `/terms` (required)

### Product funnel pages
- `/scan` (handles scan kickoff; can be same page as `/` if preferred)
- `/scan/preview/:scanId` (preview results without login)
- `/signup?scanId=...` (gates full report)
- `/report/:scanId` (full report; requires auth)

### App routes (existing)
- Keep existing app routes intact. Ensure no breaking changes.

Routing decision:
- If the current app is at `/`, move it to `/app` (or similar) and update all internal links.

---

## 2) Landing Page Content Requirements (UI Sections)
Build landing page sections in this exact order (single page):

### Section A: Hero (above the fold)
Components:
- H1 headline
- Subheadline
- URL input field
- Primary CTA button: “Run Free SEO Scan”
- Microcopy under CTA: “No credit card. No contracts. No agencies.”

Copy (initial v1):
- H1: “SEO, Automated — From Diagnosis to Deployment”
- Sub: “Arclo turns proven, real-world SEO workflows into automation — finding issues, prioritizing fixes, and pushing changes so you can focus on your business.”

Behavior:
- User enters URL and clicks CTA -> starts scan -> routes to `/scan/preview/:scanId` (or shows inline progress then routes).
Validation:
- Accept domains with or without protocol.
- Normalize to `https://` unless user explicitly provides `http://`.
- Basic validation: must parse to a host; reject obvious invalid strings.

### Section B: “Why Arclo Exists” (story block)
Short narrative paragraph block (hardcoded copy v1, editable later in CMS):
- “Arclo was built after replacing multiple SEO firms for a real psychiatry clinic…”
(Exact text can be stored in a constants file for easy editing.)

### Section C: How It Works (3 steps)
Cards or columns with:
1) Diagnose
2) Decide
3) Deploy
Include a single bold line under cards:
- “Most SEO tools stop at reports. Arclo doesn’t.”

### Section D: Differentiation (3 comparisons)
Three blocks:
- Arclo vs Agencies
- Arclo vs SEO Tools
- What you get instead
Each block: 4–6 bullet points.

### Section E: Who it’s for (self-qualification)
Two columns:
- “Perfect for” list
- “Probably not for” list

### Section F: Preview Value (screenshot/mock block)
For v1:
- Use a static mock “Diagnosis Summary” panel and “Top 3 Fixes” list.
- Later we can replace with actual preview component, but ship with mock quickly if needed.

### Section G: Final CTA
Repeat URL input + “Run Free SEO Scan” button.

### Footer
Include:
- Privacy, Terms
- Contact email or support link
- Copyright
- Optional “Built in public” line later

---

## 3) Funnel Behavior (Scan -> Preview -> Gate -> Full Report)
### Step 1: Scan kickoff
Implement a scan kickoff endpoint call:
- `POST /api/scan`
Payload:
- `{ url: "https://example.com" }`
Response:
- `{ scanId: "abc123", status: "queued" | "running" }`

Front-end behavior:
- After kickoff, route to `/scan/preview/:scanId`.
- Show progress UI (spinner + “Analyzing SEO, UX, performance…”).
- Poll scan status:
  - `GET /api/scan/:scanId/status` every 2–3 seconds until `complete` or `error`.

### Step 2: Preview results (no auth)
Preview page requirements:
- Display 1–3 findings (real findings if available).
- Display a blurred/locked “Full roadmap” section.
- CTA: “Create free account to see full report + deploy fixes”
Button -> `/signup?scanId=:scanId`

Preview data endpoint:
- `GET /api/scan/:scanId/preview`
Response example:
- `{ findings: [{title, severity, impact, effort, summary}], scoreSummary: {...} }`

### Step 3: Signup gate
Signup page:
- Standard email/password OR existing auth (whatever exists today).
- After signup/login, redirect to `/report/:scanId`.

### Step 4: Full report (auth required)
`/report/:scanId`:
- Require auth. If not logged in, redirect to `/signup?scanId=...`.
- Display full findings, prioritized list, and the “Deploy” CTA.

---

## 4) “Deploy” CTA (v1 scope)
For v1, “Deploy fixes” can:
- Create a ticket/task item in the dev queue (existing workflow), OR
- Generate an implementation plan.
Even if actual deployment automation is incomplete, the UI should:
- Show a button: “Send to Crew / Dev Queue”
- Confirm with success toast + “We’ve added this to your queue.”

API:
- `POST /api/scan/:scanId/deploy`
Payload:
- `{ selectedFixIds: [...] }` OR `{ mode: "all" }`
Response:
- `{ ok: true }`

---

## 5) SEO Implementation Requirements (Technical)
### Metadata (per page)
Implement:
- `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`
- `<link rel="canonical" href="...">`
- OpenGraph tags: `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image`
- Twitter cards tags

Defaults for `/`:
- Title: “Arclo – Fully Automated SEO From Audit to Execution”
- Description: “Arclo replaces SEO agencies and tools by automating diagnosis, prioritization, and deployment. Stop managing SEO. Start running your business.”
- H1 must exist and match primary message.

### Robots & sitemap
- `/robots.txt` with:
  - Allow `/`
  - Disallow private app routes (if needed): `/app`, `/report`, etc.
- `/sitemap.xml` including public routes:
  - `/`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/how-it-works`, `/use-cases`

### Performance
- Avoid heavy client-side rendering for the landing page if possible.
- Minimize JS bundle for `/`.
- Ensure Lighthouse basics: no CLS issues, fast LCP.

---

## 6) Analytics / Event Tracking (Required)
Implement event tracking (GA4, PostHog, or whatever is already used).

Track events:
- `landing_cta_click` (properties: url_entered_boolean)
- `scan_started` (scanId, domain)
- `scan_preview_viewed` (scanId)
- `signup_viewed` (scanId)
- `signup_completed` (scanId)
- `report_viewed` (scanId)
- `deploy_clicked` (scanId, fixCount)

If no analytics exists yet:
- Implement lightweight internal logging for v1 and wire GA4 later, but keep event hooks in place.

---

## 7) UI/UX Requirements (Design Notes)
- Keep branding minimal: Arclo name + clean type.
- No “AI-powered” hero callout.
- Use simple components:
  - Cards for steps
  - Bullets for differentiation
  - Clear spacing for readability
- Mobile first:
  - Hero CTA should be visible without scrolling
  - Input and button large enough for thumbs
- Add loading states and error states:
  - Invalid URL
  - Scan error
  - Timeout

---

## 8) Implementation Tasks Breakdown (Ticketable)
### Ticket 1: Add marketing routes + move app to /app
- Create `/` landing route
- Move existing app entry point to `/app`
- Update internal navigation links

### Ticket 2: Build landing page UI sections A–G
- Implement hero CTA with URL input
- Add story, steps, differentiation, who-for, preview mock, footer

### Ticket 3: Implement scan kickoff + preview page
- Add `POST /api/scan`
- Add status polling endpoint
- Add preview endpoint + preview UI

### Ticket 4: Signup gating and report access control
- Ensure auth redirects work with `scanId`
- Require auth for `/report/:scanId`

### Ticket 5: Add SEO tech (meta/OG/canonical/robots/sitemap)
- Implement per-route metadata
- Add robots.txt + sitemap.xml

### Ticket 6: Add analytics events
- Add event hooks in CTA and funnel steps

---

## 9) Edge Cases & Guardrails
- Normalize URLs consistently (store normalized URL in DB).
- Prevent repeated scans for same user+domain within a short interval unless allowed.
- If scan is slow, show “We’ll email you when ready” option (optional v1).
- Ensure public pages do not leak private scan details for other users:
  - Preview endpoints should require a signed token OR limit preview to a short-lived scanId not guessable.

---

## 10) QA Checklist
- Landing page loads and renders correctly on mobile
- CTA starts scan and routes to preview
- Preview shows at least 1 finding (or mock fallback)
- Signup redirects back to the correct report
- Report page blocks unauthenticated access
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml accessible
- Title/meta/OG tags present
- Analytics events firing
- No console errors
