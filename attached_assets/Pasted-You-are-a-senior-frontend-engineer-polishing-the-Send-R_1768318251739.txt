You are a senior frontend engineer polishing the **Send Reports** action card. The functionality is correct, but the **button spacing, sizing, and hierarchy are visually off**, reducing clarity and perceived quality. Fix this with a strict layout system.

This is a **UI-only spacing and alignment fix**.

---

## CORE ISSUE

The two actions:

* Send Business Report
* Send Technical Report

are visually:

* too close together
* not clearly separated as distinct actions
* lacking consistent padding and internal alignment
* feeling like text rows instead of buttons

They should feel like **two intentional choices**, not list items.

---

## TARGET VISUAL STANDARD

These two actions should look like:

* Equal-weight action buttons
* Clear vertical separation
* Large, comfortable click targets
* Consistent internal spacing
* Calm, premium, glassy

Think: *“I can confidently click either one.”*

---

## REQUIRED LAYOUT CHANGES

### 1) Wrap both actions in a vertical action stack

Create a container with:

* `flex flex-col`
* `gap-4` (or equivalent 16–20px spacing)

Do NOT rely on margins between buttons — use a controlled gap.

---

### 2) Normalize button height and padding

Each report button must have:

* Minimum height: **56px**
* Padding:

  * Horizontal: 20–24px
  * Vertical: 14–16px
* Rounded corners consistent with other cards
* Full-width inside the card

This ensures:

* Equal visual weight
* Good accessibility
* Premium feel

---

### 3) Internal button layout (important)

Inside each button:

**Left side**

* Icon
* Title (primary text)
* Subtitle (secondary text)

**Right side**

* Optional chevron or arrow (subtle)

Implementation:

* Use `flex items-center justify-between`
* Left content is `flex items-center gap-3`
* Text stack is `flex flex-col leading-tight`

Do NOT center text vertically without structure — it causes misalignment.

---

### 4) Increase separation from card description

Add **more top spacing** between:

* The card description text
* The first report button

Recommendation:

* 20–24px margin-top after description

This visually groups:

* Explanation
* Then actions

---

### 5) Subtle hover / focus affordance

On hover/focus:

* Slight background lift (very subtle)
* Border glow intensifies slightly
* Cursor clearly indicates clickability

Do NOT add:

* Color changes
* Animations
* New shadows

Subtlety is key.

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

* Do NOT stack buttons without spacing
* Do NOT make them text-only links
* Do NOT reduce font size
* Do NOT change color tokens
* Do NOT add new icons or copy

This is strictly about **spacing, sizing, and alignment**.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking done, verify:

* The two buttons feel like **two clear choices**
* There is comfortable vertical spacing between them
* Both buttons are the same height
* Click targets feel large and intentional
* The card feels as polished as **Fix Everything For Me**

If the buttons still feel “tight” or “crowded”, increase spacing again.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Spacing is hierarchy.**

If users hesitate or misclick, the spacing is wrong.
Fix that first.

---

Once this is done, this card will fully match the quality of the rest of the dashboard.
