Replit Prompt: Fix Action Queue CTA Colors + Make Source Pills Filled (High-Emphasis Style)

Context
In the Action Queue cards on Mission Control, the call-to-action buttons (“Review”, “Approve”, “Export Prompt”) are not using the correct visual hierarchy, and the “Sources” pills (e.g., Hemingway, Lookout) are outlined/transparent, which weakens their importance.

This section represents **work to be done**, so it must visually signal action and confidence.

---

## Goals

1. Make CTAs visually consistent with the rest of the app (My Crew / Arclo Pro)
2. Make “Sources” pills **filled**, high-emphasis, and readable at a glance
3. Preserve existing colors per agent, but increase contrast and weight

## 1. Call-to-Action Buttons (Review / Approve / Export Prompt)

### Button hierarchy (required)

* **Primary action**: `Approve`
* **Secondary action**: `Review`
* **Tertiary action**: `Export Prompt`

### Styling rules

**Approve**

* Use **Arclo primary gradient button**
* Filled, rounded pill
* Subtle glow / lift on hover
* Highest visual priority

**Review**

* Dark glass button (same style as My Crew secondary actions)
* Filled background (not outline)
* Subtle border + hover glow

**Export Prompt**

* Muted tertiary button
* No gradient
* Reduced opacity until hover
* Still readable, but clearly not primary

### Remove

* Flat gray buttons
* Outlined-only buttons for primary actions
* Inconsistent padding or font weight

---

## 2. Sources Pills (Hemingway, Lookout, etc.)

### Current issue

Source pills are outlined/transparent, which makes them feel optional or inactive.

### Required change

All source pills must be **filled** using their agent’s color.

### Styling rules for source pills

* Background: agent color at ~85–90% opacity
* Text: white (or near-white) for contrast
* Border: none (or very subtle inner border)
* Rounded pill shape (match other chips)
* Font weight slightly higher than body text

### Keep

* Each agent’s unique color
* Same ordering and content

### Remove

* Transparent or outline-only pills
* Low-contrast text on dark background

---

## 3. Severity / Effort Chips (High / Medium / Quick)

Make these visually distinct from source pills:

* Severity (High / Medium):

  * Filled, warm colors
  * Slight glow
* Effort (Quick / Medium):

  * Neutral filled chips
  * Lower emphasis than severity

Do not mix styles between source pills and severity chips.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* “Approve” immediately reads as the main action
* “Review” is clearly secondary but still actionable
* “Export Prompt” is visible but not competing
* Source pills are bold, filled, and scannable
* No outlined/transparent pills remain in the Action Queue
* The Action Queue visually matches the urgency of the recommendations

---

## Guardrails

* Do not change layout or behavior
* Do not introduce new colors
* Reuse existing agent color tokens
* This is a styling refinement only

---

Deliverable

* Updated Action Queue card styles
* Updated source pill styles
* Buttons consistent with My Crew + Arclo Pro
