You are a senior front-end engineer. Standardize the **Metrics / KPI section UI** across ALL agent pages so they match the styling and layout used by **Natasha** and **Lookout** (these two are the canonical reference implementations).

Goal
Many agent pages have KPI sections that don’t follow the standard (spacing, card sizing, accent lines, icon styling, missing-state colors). Fix them so every agent’s KPI section looks and behaves exactly like Natasha/Lookout.

Agents in scope
Apply to every agent page in the left nav (at minimum): Natasha, Lookout, Popular, Scotty, Speedster, Sentinel, Hemingway, Beacon, Atlas, Draper, Socrates (and any others present).

Definition of “Standard”
Use Natasha/Lookout as the single source of truth for:

* KPI grid layout (row/column count, responsive behavior)
* KPI card dimensions (height, padding, border radius)
* Typography (value size, label size, weight, letter spacing)
* Accent treatment (agent color line/border/glow)
* Icon placement (top-right icon button/indicator)
* Medal/crown badge styling (gold/silver/bronze)
* Missing-state styling (gold hue, not blue)
* Hover/focus states and subtle shadows

Implementation requirements

1. Create a reusable KPI component (or ensure we already have one)

* Identify the KPI card + KPI grid components used by Natasha/Lookout.
* Extract them into reusable components if not already shared:

  * `client/src/components/kpi/KpiGrid.tsx`
  * `client/src/components/kpi/KpiCard.tsx`
  * `client/src/components/kpi/kpiStyles.ts` (or CSS module / Tailwind helpers)
* The goal is: other agent pages import and use the same components, not copy/paste.

2. Centralize theme + agent accent colors

* Ensure each agent has a defined accent color (existing “agent color” system).
* KPI cards must show the accent consistently:

  * either a left border line, top border line, or subtle glow identical to Natasha/Lookout.
* Do not hardcode colors per page. Use the theme/agent config.

3. Replace custom KPI implementations on other pages

* For each agent page:

  * Remove its bespoke KPI markup and styling.
  * Replace with `<KpiGrid>` + `<KpiCard>` and pass the same props structure used by Natasha/Lookout.
* Maintain each page’s KPI content/values, but standardize the visuals.

4. Ensure consistent missing/empty behavior

* If a KPI value is missing, render a deterministic numeric fallback (e.g., 0 / 0%) rather than blank.
* If a KPI card represents a “missing” or “needs attention” state, it must use the gold hue style (same as Natasha/Lookout) rather than blue.

5. QA checklist (must validate)

* Compare each agent page KPI section to Natasha/Lookout:

  * identical spacing and card sizes
  * identical typography scale
  * identical accent line styling
  * icons aligned
  * responsive layout matches
* Test at common widths:

  * desktop wide
  * laptop
  * tablet breakpoint

Acceptance criteria

* Every agent page KPI section renders using the same shared KPI components as Natasha/Lookout.
* No agent page uses one-off KPI CSS/classes.
* Visual differences are limited to the agent accent color and the KPI data itself.
* No KPI section shows blank placeholders or broken alignment.
