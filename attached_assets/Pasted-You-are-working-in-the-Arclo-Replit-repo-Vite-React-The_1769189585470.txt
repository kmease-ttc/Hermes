You are working in the Arclo Replit repo (Vite + React). The marketing homepage has major regressions: invisible text, low contrast, missing footer, compressed hero/header spacing, “Generate My Site” buttons look flat, testimonial/how-it-works text is washed out, and the trust badges are using the same icon and are hard to read. Fix this thoroughly without breaking the app/dashboard styling.

GOAL
Restore a clean, premium, high-contrast “white hero” marketing design across the entire homepage, with consistent typography, readable section headings, readable cards, and a stable button system. Ensure marketing styles do NOT leak into dashboard/app pages.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- No “white on white” or washed-out text anywhere.
- All section headings must be clearly visible.
- Fix the 1px purple artifact on the Analyze button.
- Trust badges need UNIQUE icons (4 different icons).
- Restore footer and ensure it is readable and present.
- Keep the above-the-fold spacious (not compressed).
- Make “Analyze My Website” clearly primary; “Generate My Site” clearly secondary.
- Ensure the “How it works” cards and “Why Arclo” comparison table are readable.
- Ensure business chips (“Plumbing”, “HVAC”, etc.) are readable.
- Ensure FAQ accordion text is readable.
- Ensure testimonials are readable and visually prominent.

APPROACH (IMPORTANT)
1) Scope marketing styles so they only apply to the marketing pages:
   - Add a root wrapper class to the landing page: className="marketing-shell"
   - Ensure marketing CSS is only applied under .marketing-shell (or body[data-theme="marketing"]).
   - Do NOT change global tokens in a way that impacts the dashboard/app.

2) Fix contrast + spacing + UI consistency using a small “marketing hotfix” stylesheet:
   - Create (or update) a dedicated file: src/styles/arclo-marketing-regression-fix.css
   - Import it AFTER existing marketing styles (either in main.tsx or the marketing page).
   - All selectors MUST be prefixed with .marketing-shell to avoid leakage.

3) Fix each broken section specifically (do not stop at the hero):
   A) Header / Nav
     - Add subtle bottom border and/or translucent background (white w/ blur).
     - Increase height/padding so nav doesn’t look compressed.
     - Ensure nav links are dark and readable.

   B) Hero
     - Increase top padding and spacing so above-the-fold feels premium.
     - Keep headline large; apply gradient only to the emphasis word (e.g., “traffic”).
     - Remove redundant paragraph copy if it duplicates the step line.
     - Ensure step line is readable and uses clear dot separators.
     - CTA row: input + Analyze button. Generate CTA is secondary and visually distinct.
     - Fix Analyze button’s right-edge 1px purple artifact (likely border/background-clip issue).

   C) Trust badges row (Built for service businesses / Cancel anytime / Your changes logged / SEO best practices, automated)
     - Each badge must have: pill container + gradient-tinted icon bubble + dark text.
     - Use 4 different icons.
     - Replace any repeated icon usage with unique icons.

   D) Testimonials
     - Card backgrounds must be white, borders subtle, shadows soft.
     - Quote text must be dark and readable.
     - Names/roles visible; star ratings visible.
     - Remove any styling that turns this text “nearly white”.

   E) How It Works (1-2-3)
     - Fix invisible text.
     - Number badges must be visible (gradient circle with white number).
     - Card titles/body must be readable.

   F) “Why local businesses choose Arclo” (or equivalent benefits grid)
     - Fix invisible heading and card text.
     - Icons should be visible with consistent style.

   G) Business chip row (“Arclo is built for businesses that serve customers locally.” + chips)
     - Fix invisible section title and chip labels.
     - Chips should look like subtle pills with readable text and visible icons.

   H) Examples (“See what Arclo builds”)
     - Fix invisible headings/subtitles.
     - Cards must have readable labels and clear “View demo” link styling.

   I) Comparison table (“Why Arclo?”)
     - Fix invisible headers and row labels.
     - Ensure “Arclo” column reads clearly; apply subtle highlight styling.
     - Ensure all cells have good contrast.

   J) Footer + final CTA section
     - Restore a real footer: visible heading, subtitle, CTA button consistent with primary gradient style.
     - Footer must not be “gone” / empty; ensure links and small print are visible.

DELIVERABLES
- Make the homepage look correct in Preview across all sections (not just hero).
- Provide a summary of:
  1) Which files you changed
  2) What you fixed in each section
  3) How you ensured marketing styles don’t affect the app/dashboard
- Ensure there are no console errors and the site builds/renders.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (DO THIS)
- Add className="marketing-shell" to the homepage root container.
- Create/update: src/styles/arclo-marketing-regression-fix.css
  - Put all contrast/spacing fixes in there, scoped under .marketing-shell.
- Add 4 unique trust icons:
  - Create folder src/assets/icons/
  - Add: trust-built.svg, trust-cancel.svg, trust-logged.svg, trust-best.svg
- Update the Trust badges component to import and render those 4 different icons.
  - If there is no component, create one (TrustRow) and use it in the homepage.

VISUAL GUIDELINES
- Background: subtle soft radial gradients on white (very light).
- Text: primary very dark (#0b1220-ish), secondary muted gray (#516071-ish).
- Buttons: primary gradient (purple→pink→orange), secondary white with subtle border.
- Cards: white, soft border, soft shadow, rounded corners.
- Spacing: generous; avoid tight vertical compression.

STOP CONDITION
Do not stop after hero looks okay. Scroll and fix EVERY section listed above until all text is readable and the page feels coherent again.
