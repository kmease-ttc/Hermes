Perfect. This is the moment to **lock the model** and stop iterating by taste.

Below is a **clear, repeatable image model + sourcing system** you can apply to *every remaining example* so they all feel consistent, credible, and portfolio-grade — without drifting back into weird stock or interior décor.

# Example Images — Final Model & Rollout Instructions

## This Is the Model We’re Using (Lock This In)

The HVAC example you just aligned on establishes the correct pattern:

**Model = “Calm professional service + environment + trust”**

Not:

* Interiors
* Decor
* Isolated equipment
* Action-heavy repair shots

Yes:

* Real technicians
* Real environments
* Calm posture
* Marketing-hero framing

This model now applies to **every industry card**.

---

## The Universal Image Formula (Use This Everywhere)

Every example image must satisfy **all 4 criteria**:

1. **Human present OR implied**

   * Technician, professional, or crew
   * OR environment that clearly implies service (yard, home exterior, clinic lobby)

2. **Calm, not mid-action**

   * Standing
   * Inspecting
   * Light interaction
   * No tools raised, no strain, no “work face”

3. **Environment > object**

   * Home exterior, yard, clinic, storefront
   * Not close-ups of equipment or tools

4. **Hero-ready**

   * Works as a homepage hero
   * Has negative space
   * Could support a headline + CTA overlay

If any image fails one of these → reject it.

### Any New Trade (General Rule)

When adding new industries later (electricians, roofing, etc.):

> Default to **professional standing calmly in environment**, not doing the task.

---

## Crop & Framing Rules (Critical)

All images must be normalized the same way:

* **Aspect ratio:** 16:9
* **Crop:** medium-wide
* **Subject placement:** left or right third
* **Negative space:** required
* **No extreme close-ups**

If you can’t imagine placing a headline over it, it’s wrong.

---

## Overlay Rules (Do Not Skip)

Every image gets a **contextual overlay**:

```
{Industry} Website · {City, State}
```

Optional second line (lighter):

```
{Service category}
```

This does two things:

* Anchors the image as a **website preview**
* Prevents “is this just a photo?” confusion

---

## Source Strategy (So This Scales)

### Preferred (Long-Term)

* Replace all images with **real Arclo-generated site screenshots**
* Screenshot above-the-fold hero
* This becomes the permanent system

### Interim (Now)

* Use curated stock photos that meet the model
* Save them locally under:

  ```
  /examples/{industry}/{slug}.jpg
  ```
* Do **not** hotlink random URLs

---

## Acceptance Checklist (Use This Before Commit)

Before approving an image, ask:

* Does this look like a real business website hero?
* Would a homeowner trust this company?
* Is it calm and professional?
* Is the industry instantly obvious?
* Does it match the HVAC example vibe?

If the answer to any is “no” → replace.

---

## One Rule to Rule Them All

> **If the image sells comfort, trust, and professionalism — it belongs.
> If it sells labor, tools, or effort — it does not.**

---

If you want next steps, we can:

* Batch-curate **exact Unsplash IDs** for every remaining industry
* Create a **shared ExampleImage contract** so devs can’t regress
* Or start replacing these with **real generated site screenshots** now that the layout is stable

This model is solid. Now we just apply it consistently.
