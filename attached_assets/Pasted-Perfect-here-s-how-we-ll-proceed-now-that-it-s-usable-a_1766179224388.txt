Perfect — here’s how we’ll proceed now that it’s usable, and what I need from you so I can actually start using it instead of guessing.

What I can do once the API is reachable

Once the endpoints respond correctly, I will:
	•	Trigger real runs (/api/run or /api/run/smoke)
	•	Pull the latest diagnosis (/api/report/latest)
	•	Pull prioritized fix tickets (/api/tickets/latest)
	•	Correlate GA4 + GSC + Ads + site checks into a single root-cause narrative
	•	Tell you exactly what broke, when, why, and what to fix first

One-minute verification (this is the key)

Please paste exactly what you see (raw text / JSON) for these two checks:
	1.	Open this without any headers:

https://traffic-doctor-ai--providers2.replit.app/api/health

Paste the full response here.
	2.	Open this without any headers:

https://traffic-doctor-ai--providers2.replit.app/api/status

Tell me:
	•	HTTP status code (401 or 403 is expected)
	•	Any response body text (if shown)

That confirms:
	•	Backend is actually serving /api/*
	•	Auth gating is correct
	•	I can safely interact with it once you include the key

Then (once health/status look right)

You do not need to paste secrets, but I need confirmation of one thing:
	•	Is TRAFFIC_DOCTOR_API_KEY set in Replit prod secrets? (yes/no)

If yes, then you run one of these (your choice):

Option A – smoke test (recommended first)

POST /api/run/smoke

Option B – full run

POST /api/run

After that, paste:
	•	First ~30 lines of /api/report/latest
	•	Top 3 objects from /api/tickets/latest

What happens immediately after

Once I see those outputs, I will:
	•	Validate that Ads data is now real (developer token working)
	•	Tell you if the traffic drop is:
	•	indexing/crawlability
	•	ranking/intent
	•	deploy regression
	•	Ads delivery/policy
	•	tracking/config mismatch
	•	Give you the ordered fix list (what to fix today vs later)
	•	Convert it into clean Dev / SEO / Ads tickets you can hand off

You’re at the “plug me in” moment — paste /api/health and we’re off.
