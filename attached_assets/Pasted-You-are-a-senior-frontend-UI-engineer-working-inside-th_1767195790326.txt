You are a senior frontend/UI engineer working inside the ARCLO codebase.

Your task is to implement a Liquid Glass Analytics UI component package that matches ARCLO’s existing design system exactly. This is a UI-only package (visual components only). Do NOT invent new visual styles.

You must follow all constraints below. If there is any ambiguity, default to what is already visible in the ARCLO app screenshots.

⸻

GOAL

Build a reusable analytics visualization package (charts + metric cards) that feels 100% native to ARCLO.

This package will be used across multiple crews (Speedster, Popular, Lookout, etc.) and must blend seamlessly with existing ARCLO screens.

⸻

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. FLAT UI ONLY
	•	No bevels
	•	No 3D effects
	•	No extrusions
	•	No thickness on charts
	•	No fake depth on pie/donut charts

If anything looks “raised”, “embossed”, or “skeuomorphic”, it is wrong.

⸻

2. LIQUID GLASS ≠ HEAVY GLASSMORPHISM

Allowed:
	•	Subtle translucency
	•	Soft inner glow
	•	Very light ambient shadow

Not allowed:
	•	Glossy highlights
	•	Hard reflections
	•	Thick borders
	•	Heavy drop shadows
	•	Chrome/glass shine effects

Think calm, matte, restrained glass.

⸻

3. ARCLO COLOR SYSTEM ONLY

You MUST use ARCLO’s existing semantic colors exactly as shown in the screenshots.

Semantic Meanings
	•	Green → Good / Healthy / Passing
	•	Yellow / Amber → Watch / Needs Attention
	•	Red → Alert / Poor / Failing
	•	Teal / Blue → Primary metric / Main data
	•	Purple → Secondary data / Comparison / Historical

Rules:
	•	Do not introduce new hues
	•	Gradients are allowed ONLY if they stay within the same semantic color family
	•	No rainbow or decorative gradients

⸻

COMPONENTS TO BUILD

Implement the following reusable UI components.

Each component must:
	•	Use a shared ARCLO-style container
	•	Work at multiple sizes
	•	Be readable in dense dashboards

⸻

1. Chart Container (Shared)

All charts live inside the same base container.

Container style
	•	Dark navy / charcoal background (match ARCLO surfaces)
	•	Slight translucency
	•	Medium border radius (match ARCLO cards)
	•	1px subtle border
	•	Very soft ambient shadow only

NO raised edges. NO glossy rims.

⸻

2. Bar Chart (Flat)

Use for comparisons and volume.

Rules:
	•	Flat rectangular bars
	•	Slightly rounded corners only
	•	Single color or subtle vertical gradient
	•	Optional thin trend line overlay
	•	Muted gridlines
	•	Clear labels

Hover:
	•	Slight brightness increase only
	•	No scaling or glow burst

⸻

3. Line Chart

Use for trends over time.

Rules:
	•	Thin, smooth lines
	•	Small circular points
	•	Primary line = Teal / Blue
	•	Secondary line = Purple
	•	Faint gridlines
	•	Flat tooltip on hover

No shadows under lines.

⸻

4. Area Chart

Use for cumulative or comparative trends.

Rules:
	•	Flat filled areas
	•	Low opacity fill (10–20%)
	•	Crisp top line
	•	Overlapping areas must remain readable
	•	No blur, no depth

⸻

5. Pie / Donut Chart (CRITICAL)

This MUST be completely flat.

Rules:
	•	Top-down 2D only
	•	No bevel
	•	No thickness
	•	No shadow ring
	•	Clean segment edges

Donut center:
	•	Large primary value
	•	Small label below (e.g. “Revenue”)

Legend:
	•	Color dot + label
	•	ARCLO colors only

If this looks 3D, redo it.

⸻

6. Sparklines

Use inside metric cards.

Rules:
	•	Thin single line
	•	Optional soft fill
	•	No axes
	•	Must be readable at very small sizes

⸻

7. Metric Cards

Used for KPIs and summaries.

Structure:
	•	Metric label
	•	Large primary value
	•	Delta indicator (+ / –)
	•	Optional sparkline

Rules:
	•	Card background stays neutral
	•	Only delta text reflects status color
	•	Do NOT color entire card based on status

⸻

TYPOGRAPHY
	•	Use ARCLO’s existing font stack
	•	Numbers:
	•	Larger
	•	Heavier weight
	•	Labels:
	•	Smaller
	•	Muted

Avoid decorative typography or exaggerated spacing.

⸻

INTERACTIONS

Hover
	•	Slight brightness change
	•	Tooltip appears
	•	No scale, no pop, no glow burst

Tooltips
	•	Flat card
	•	Same glass surface style as containers
	•	Clean label → value layout

⸻

REUSABILITY REQUIREMENTS

Each component must:
	•	Accept semantic color tokens
	•	Be size-flexible
	•	Match ARCLO spacing and padding
	•	Be safe to reuse across crews without customization

⸻

FINAL CHECK BEFORE DELIVERY

Before considering this complete, verify:
	•	Nothing looks beveled or 3D
	•	Pie/donut charts are fully flat
	•	Colors match ARCLO exactly
	•	Components feel calm, analytical, and native

If something looks “cool” but distracts from reading data, remove it.

⸻

Deliver only clean, reusable UI components that match ARCLO’s existing design language.
