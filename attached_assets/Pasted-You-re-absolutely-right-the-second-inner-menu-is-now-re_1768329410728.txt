You’re absolutely right — **the second (inner) menu is now redundant** and is actively hurting clarity. This is a **clean architectural simplification**, not a cosmetic tweak.

Below are **very prescriptive, implementation-ready instructions** for your vibe coding agent to remove the duplicate menu safely and correctly.

---

You are a senior frontend engineer simplifying the **Hermes SEO app layout**. The app currently renders **two navigation menus**:

* A **primary app navigation** on the far left (correct)
* A **secondary in-app navigation** inside the content area (redundant)

Your task is to **remove the inner/secondary menu entirely** and make the far-left navigation the **single source of truth** for navigation.

This is a **layout + routing cleanup**, not a feature change.

---

## CORE DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

* ❌ Remove the **inner/right-side navigation menu**
* ✅ Keep the **far-left navigation only**
* ✅ All pages must be fully usable via the far-left menu alone

There should be **one navigation paradigm**, not two.

---

## IDENTIFY THE REDUNDANT MENU

The menu to remove:

* Appears inside the main content column
* Repeats items like:

  * Mission Control
  * Crew
  * Achievements
  * Integrations
  * Settings
  * Help
* Uses purple highlight styling
* Sits under the top header inside the page layout

This menu is **no longer needed** now that Mission Control is the primary experience.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### 1) Locate the layout component

Find the layout responsible for rendering the inner menu, likely:

* `AppLayout.tsx`
* `DashboardLayout.tsx`
* `AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`
* or a component that wraps `/app/*` routes

Look for a structure similar to:

```tsx
<Sidebar />
<MainContent>
  <SecondaryNav />   // <-- REMOVE THIS
  <PageContent />
</MainContent>
```

---

### 2) Remove the secondary menu component

* Completely remove the `SecondaryNav` (or equivalent) component
* Do NOT hide it with CSS
* Do NOT leave empty spacing where it was

The main content area should now:

* Start immediately after the header
* Use the full remaining horizontal space

---

### 3) Adjust layout grid / spacing

After removal:

* Expand the main content container to use the full width
* Remove any left padding/margin that existed to accommodate the inner menu

Specifically:

* Check for:

  * `pl-*`, `ml-*`, grid columns, or flex gaps tied to the secondary nav
* Normalize spacing so content aligns cleanly under the header

---

### 4) Ensure navigation still works

Verify that **every route previously accessible from the inner menu** is accessible via the far-left nav:

* Mission Control
* Crew
* Achievements
* Integrations
* Settings
* Help

If any route is missing:

* Add it to the far-left menu
* Do NOT reintroduce a secondary menu

---

### 5) Remove any menu-specific state or styling

* Remove:

  * active state logic for the inner menu
  * highlight styles
  * keyboard navigation hooks
* Ensure there is no dead code referencing the removed menu

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking complete, confirm:

* Only **one navigation menu** is visible (far left)
* No duplicated menu items appear anywhere else
* Main content uses the full width cleanly
* No empty gutter or awkward spacing remains
* Navigation between all sections works as expected

If you can point at **only one place** where navigation lives, it’s correct.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **One product. One navigation. One mental model.**

Multiple menus imply multiple products.
This cleanup makes Hermes feel focused and intentional.

Implement this change and stop — this is a strong simplification win.
