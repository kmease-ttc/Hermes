You are modifying UI. You MUST follow these visual and accessibility constraints exactly. If you violate them, the task is considered failed even if functionality works.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE VISUAL RULES

### 1. Contrast (hard requirement)

All text must meet **WCAG AA contrast minimums**.

* Normal text: **contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1**
* Large text (≥18px or ≥14px bold): **≥ 3:1**
* Numeric KPIs must be readable at a glance.

If a color combination fails contrast:

* You must change the text color (not just the background).
* Prefer dark text on light backgrounds.

**Default safe choices**

* Primary text: `#111827` (near-black)
* Secondary text: `#374151`
* Muted text: `#6B7280`
* Card background: `#FFFFFF`
* Page background: `#F9FAFB`

Do NOT invent pastel-on-pastel combinations for text.

---

### 2. KPI / Number Visibility (critical)

All numeric values (counts, rankings, deltas):

* Must use **font-weight ≥ 600**
* Must use **font-size ≥ 20px**
* Must use **high-contrast color** (near-black or strong semantic color)

Never render numbers in:

* low-opacity text
* light gradients
* pale green / pale purple on white

If I cannot read the number in one second, it is wrong.

---

### 3. Cards must be visually bounded

Every card must have **at least one** of the following:

* Border: `1px solid #E5E7EB`
* OR shadow: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`
* OR clearly darker background than the page

Cards may NOT “blend into” the page.

---

### 4. Background gradients (restricted)

Gradients are allowed **only** for:

* section headers
* decorative separators

Gradients are **NOT allowed** behind:

* body text
* numeric KPIs
* tables
* lists

If text sits on a gradient, it must be:

* white `#FFFFFF`
* AND pass contrast checks

---

### 5. Locked / Disabled states

Locked cards must still be readable.

Rules:

* Do NOT reduce opacity below **0.7**
* Do NOT blur text
* Use a badge or overlay instead:

  * “Locked”
  * “Subscribe to unlock”

The user must be able to read *what they’re missing*.

---

## REQUIRED SELF-CHECK BEFORE CLAIMING “DONE”

Before you say the UI is complete, you MUST verify:

1. Can all numbers be read clearly on a laptop at normal brightness?
2. Is every section distinguishable from the background?
3. Does any text disappear on white or light gray?
4. Can I screenshot this and annotate it without squinting?

If the answer to any is “no”, fix it first.

---

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

The following automatically fail the task:

* Text rendered in light gray on white
* Pastel text on pastel backgrounds
* KPIs that require zooming to read
* “Looks nice” but unreadable UI

Clarity beats aesthetics.

Proceed with UI changes only after enforcing these rules.
