Replit Prompt: Stack Industry Benchmark Metrics Vertically (One Metric Per Line)

Problem
In the “Compare to Industry Benchmarks” panel, multiple metrics (Total Sessions, Total Clicks, Impressions, Conversion Rate benchmark) are being displayed in a compressed horizontal layout. This makes them hard to scan and visually misaligned with the rest of Mission Control.

Goal
Each benchmark metric should appear **on its own horizontal row**, stacked vertically, with clear spacing and consistent alignment.

This is a layout-only fix. Do not change data, copy, or styling beyond spacing/alignment.

## Required Changes

### 1) Convert the metrics container to a vertical stack

* Replace any grid or flex-row layout with a vertical stack:

  * `flex flex-col gap-*`
* Each metric becomes its own row/card inside the panel.

### 2) One metric per line

For example, the following must each be on its own line:

* Total Sessions
* Total Clicks
* Impressions
* Conversion Rate vs Industry (with percentile bar)

Do NOT group them horizontally.

### 3) Standardize row layout

Each row should follow the same structure:

* Left: Metric label
* Center: Primary value
* Right (if applicable): Context badge or indicator (e.g., Needs Improvement)

Example row layout:

```
[ Metric Name ]     [ Value ]     [ Status / Context ]
```

### 4) Conversion Rate benchmark stays visually distinct

* The Conversion Rate benchmark can remain a richer sub-card,
  but it must still occupy its **own full-width row**.
* Ensure it does not overlap or float beside other metrics.

### 5) Maintain dark glass styling

* Keep the same background, borders, glow, and typography.
* Only adjust layout, spacing, and alignment.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Each benchmark metric is displayed on its own row.
* No metrics are horizontally compressed.
* The panel is easy to scan top-to-bottom.
* The Conversion Rate benchmark no longer overlaps or crowds other content.
* Visual style remains consistent with My Crew / Mission Control.

---

## Guardrails

* Do not introduce new colors.
* Do not change metric values or copy.
* Do not add new UI elements.
* This is a structural layout fix only.

Deliverable

* Updated layout for the “Compare to Industry Benchmarks” panel with vertically stacked metrics.
