ADD INFO (“i”) TOOLTIP SYSTEM FOR ROLES AND CREW

Context:
The ship layout and crew placement are correct. We need lightweight, non-intrusive tooltips that explain what each ROLE does and what each CREW MEMBER contributes.

Tooltips must add clarity without adding visual noise.

---

### 1) ROLE SLOT TOOLTIP (EMPTY SLOTS)

For every EMPTY role slot on the ship:

Visual:
- Add a small circular “i” icon (info indicator)
- Position:
  - Top-right corner of the role bay
  - Slightly inset so it doesn’t touch the edge
- Style:
  - Muted (text-muted color)
  - Subtle border
  - Hover state: brighter

Behavior:
- Hovering the “i” shows a tooltip describing the ROLE
- Tooltip content explains:
  - What this role is responsible for
  - What kind of value it unlocks
  - Example outcome

Example (SERP Tracking):
Title: SERP Tracking  
Text: “Tracks keyword rankings and explains why positions change over time.”

---

### 2) ROLE SLOT TOOLTIP (FILLED SLOTS)

For FILLED role slots:
- Keep the role tooltip available
- The “i” icon remains visible but slightly dimmer
- Tooltip content remains ROLE-focused (not crew-focused)

This ensures users always understand what the role does, even when staffed.

---

### 3) CREW MEMBER TOOLTIP (BOT AVATAR)

For each CREW MEMBER avatar:

Behavior:
- Hovering the avatar (or long-press on mobile) shows a second tooltip

Tooltip content explains:
- Crew name
- What they specifically do within the role
- What data/actions they handle

Example (Natasha):
Title: Natasha — Competitive Intelligence  
Text: “Monitors competitors, identifies content gaps, and flags emerging threats.”

This differentiates:
- ROLE = responsibility
- CREW = execution

---

### 4) TOOLTIP STYLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Tooltips must:
- Use a dark surface (bg-surface-2)
- Have subtle border (border-subtle)
- Rounded corners
- Max width ~260px
- Small arrow pointing to trigger
- High contrast text (text-primary + text-secondary)

Do NOT:
- Use bright backgrounds
- Use large shadows
- Animate excessively

Tooltips should feel “professional SaaS,” not playful.

---

### 5) MOBILE BEHAVIOR

- On mobile:
  - Tapping the “i” opens the tooltip
  - Tapping outside closes it
- Tooltips must not push layout or cause scroll jumps

---

### 6) CONTENT SOURCE

Define tooltip copy in a single config file:

- roleTooltips.ts
- crewTooltips.ts

This allows copy updates without touching layout code.

Each role entry:
- title
- description
- exampleOutcome (optional)

Each crew entry:
- name
- shortDescription
- handledSignals (optional)

---

### 7) WHAT NOT TO CHANGE

- Do NOT change ship layout
- Do NOT resize tiles
- Do NOT add new UI panels
- Do NOT add persistent text labels inside tiles

Tooltips are the ONLY new explanatory surface.

---

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete when:
- Every role slot has an info tooltip
- Every crew avatar has a tooltip
- Tooltips are readable, subtle, and consistent
- Users can understand the ship without additional documentation
