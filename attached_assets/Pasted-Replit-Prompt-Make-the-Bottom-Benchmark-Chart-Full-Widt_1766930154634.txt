Replit Prompt: Make the Bottom Benchmark Chart Full-Width (Stop the Compressed Mini Card)

Issue
In “Compare to Industry Benchmarks”, the bottom chart card (Conversion Rate benchmark) is rendering as a narrow, compressed mini-card on the left, leaving a large empty area to the right. It should use the full width of the panel.

Goal
Make the bottom benchmark chart section span the full width of the container, matching the stacked metric rows above. No layout should feel “half empty”.

Requirements

* The Conversion Rate benchmark card must become a full-width row.
* The chart/progress bar inside it should also expand horizontally and be centered/left-aligned cleanly.
* Keep the current styling (dark glass, badge, typography) — only adjust layout and sizing.

Implementation steps

1. Locate the layout wrapper for the benchmark section (the container that holds the stacked metrics and the conversion benchmark card).
2. Remove any grid/flex settings that constrain the conversion card to a column:

   * If it’s inside a `grid` with multiple columns, set it to span all columns:

     * `col-span-full` (Tailwind) / `grid-column: 1 / -1`
   * If it’s inside a flex row, change to `flex-col` for that area.
3. Set the Conversion Rate benchmark container to:

   * `w-full`
   * `min-w-0`
4. Inside the conversion card, update inner layout:

   * Use a two-column layout ONLY if helpful (left: value + verdict, right: percentile bar), otherwise stack.
   * Ensure the bar/chart uses full width:

     * `w-full`
     * `max-w-none`
     * remove any fixed width like `w-48`, `w-56`, etc.
5. Ensure the card’s parent container does not have a max width constraint that causes shrink:

   * Remove `max-w-*` or apply it only to the overall panel, not to the inner card.
6. Confirm padding and spacing look consistent with the stacked metric rows above.

Acceptance criteria

* The conversion benchmark section spans the full width of the “Compare to Industry Benchmarks” panel.
* The chart/bar uses the available width and no longer looks squished.
* No empty dead space remains to the right of the chart.
* No other components are moved or restyled beyond layout sizing.

Notes
If the conversion benchmark is currently rendered inside its own nested “mini card,” keep that card style, but make it full width rather than a narrow column.
