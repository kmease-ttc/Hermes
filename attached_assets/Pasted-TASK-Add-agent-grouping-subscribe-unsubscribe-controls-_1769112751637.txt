TASK: Add agent grouping + subscribe/unsubscribe controls on the Agents page

GOAL
Organize agents into two sections and clearly show which agents are active vs purchasable, with a visible Subscribe / Unsubscribe action on each card.

This is an information architecture + affordance change, not backend billing logic (yet).

---

## 1) AGENT GROUPING (PAGE STRUCTURE)

### Sections to create (top → bottom)

1. **Core Agents**
   Subtitle (small, muted text):
   “These agents are included and active by default.”

2. **Additional Agents**
   Subtitle:
   “Optional agents you can add or remove at any time.”

### Rules

* Core Agents always render first
* Additional Agents render below with clear visual separation
* Use section headers (`h2`) with strong contrast

Example structure:

```
Core Agents
[agent cards...]

Additional Agents
[agent cards...]
```

Do NOT mix agents into a single grid anymore.

---

## 2) AGENT METADATA (FRONTEND MODEL)

Each agent definition must include:

* `id`
* `name`
* `description`
* `category`: `"core"` | `"additional"`
* `isSubscribed`: boolean

If `isSubscribed === true` → show **Unsubscribe**
If `isSubscribed === false` → show **Subscribe**

No pricing logic yet — just state.

---

## 3) CARD UI: SUBSCRIBE / UNSUBSCRIBE ACTION

### Placement

* Top-right corner of each agent card
* Inline button (not a dropdown)

### Button behavior (visual only for now)

* Subscribed agents:

  * Button text: **Unsubscribe**
  * Style: secondary / outline
* Not subscribed agents:

  * Button text: **Subscribe**
  * Style: primary

Example Tailwind styles:

* Subscribe:

  * `bg-purple-600 text-white hover:bg-purple-700`
* Unsubscribe:

  * `border border-slate-300 text-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-100`

Button must be clearly visible without hovering.

---

## 4) CARD STATE RULES

### Subscribed agents

* Normal contrast (current readable state)
* Status badge can remain (OK / Stale / Error)

### Unsubscribed agents

* Card still readable (DO NOT reduce opacity on text)
* Optional:

  * Slightly lighter background (`bg-slate-50`)
  * Small “Not active” label under description

Do NOT:

* Gray out text
* Use opacity on the whole card

---

## 5) INTERACTION (TEMPORARY LOGIC)

For now:

* Clicking Subscribe / Unsubscribe:

  * Toggles `isSubscribed` in local state
  * Updates button text immediately
* No backend persistence required yet
* Log to console:

  * `Subscribed to agent: {id}`
  * `Unsubscribed from agent: {id}`

This gives us UX validation without wiring billing.

---

## 6) FILES LIKELY TO CHANGE

* `src/pages/agents.tsx`
* `src/components/AgentCard.tsx`
* Agent definitions config (wherever agents are listed)
* Possibly a small helper:

  * `groupAgentsByCategory(agents)`

---

## 7) ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking done:

* Agents page has **two clearly labeled sections**
* Core agents are all grouped at the top
* Additional agents are grouped below
* Every agent card shows:

  * Name
  * Description
  * Subscribe OR Unsubscribe button (never both)
* Active agents show **Unsubscribe**
* Inactive agents show **Subscribe**
* No text contrast regressions
* No opacity-based muting

---

## 8) IMPORTANT NON-GOALS (DO NOT DO)

* Do NOT implement payments
* Do NOT hide unsubscribed agents
* Do NOT remove agent cards dynamically based on subscription
* Do NOT change backend agent execution yet

---

DONE WHEN
A user can scan the page and instantly understand:

* What’s included
* What’s optional
* What’s active
* What they can add or remove

No guessing, no hovering, no reading docs.
