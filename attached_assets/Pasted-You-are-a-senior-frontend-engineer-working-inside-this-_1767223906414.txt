Goal
Standardize the “Key Metrics” section UI across all crew pages using Speedster as the gold standard.
First apply the update to Natasha (Competitive Intelligence) and make her Key Metrics clean, visually consistent, and limited so it never overflows.

Non-negotiables

* Speedster’s Key Metrics visual design is the canonical standard (glassmorphism, spacing, typography, accent colors).
* Natasha’s Key Metrics must use the same component(s) and styling as Speedster.
* Natasha must show no more than 5 metric cards (otherwise it overflows/off-page).
* Use the “glass” styling and the same color language (subtle glow accents).
* This should become the reusable standard for every crew page.

Implementation plan

1. Identify the canonical Speedster Key Metrics component

* Locate the Speedster Key Metrics section implementation (the card grid style you like best).
* Extract (or confirm it’s already extracted) into a shared component:

  * client/src/components/metrics/KeyMetricsGrid.tsx
  * client/src/components/metrics/KeyMetricCard.tsx
* Ensure the shared component contains:

  * Glass background
  * Consistent border/shadow
  * Accent tint per metric/status
  * Proper responsive grid

2. Fix the Natasha Key Metrics section

* Locate Natasha’s page component.
* Replace Natasha’s current Key Metrics rendering with the shared KeyMetricsGrid component.
* Build a set of 5 Key Metrics for Natasha (max 5):

Recommended Natasha metrics (exact set to implement now)

1. Opportunities Found (count)
2. Competitors Tracked (count)
3. Keywords with Gaps (count)
4. Avg Rank (number or “—” if unknown)
5. Share of Voice (percent or “—”)

Rules

* If data is not available, show “—” with a subtle helper line (“Run Competitive Snapshot to populate”).
* Keep the same large, readable typography as Speedster (value big, label smaller).
* Use subtle green/teal highlight by default (consistent with glass aesthetic).
* No additional “maps”/cards beyond these five.

3. Layout / overflow constraints

* Ensure KeyMetricsGrid uses a grid that never overflows horizontally:

  * Desktop: 3 columns first row, 2 columns second row (total 5)
  * Tablet: 2 columns
  * Mobile: 1 column
* Cards must wrap and maintain spacing; no sideways scrolling.

4. Make it the standard for all crews

* Ensure KeyMetricsGrid is generic and can be used by any crew page by passing a metrics array.
* Do not allow crew-specific styling overrides.
* After Natasha is updated, confirm at least one other non-Speedster crew page is already compatible (Socrates/Hemingway) or update them to use the same shared component if they’re still using old stats blocks.

5. Verification checklist

* Speedster Key Metrics unchanged.
* Natasha Key Metrics:

  * looks like Speedster (glass, spacing, colors)
  * shows exactly 5 metric cards
  * never overflows off the page
* Confirm responsiveness by resizing preview.

Deliverables

* File paths changed
* Confirmation that Natasha now uses the shared Speedster-style KeyMetricsGrid
* Screenshot/description showing Natasha’s 5-card layout and glass styling
