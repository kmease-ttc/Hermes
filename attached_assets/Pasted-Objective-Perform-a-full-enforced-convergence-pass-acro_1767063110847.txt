Objective
Perform a **full, enforced convergence pass** across *all crew dashboards* so they **exactly match the Speedster model**, not “kind of”, not “mostly”, but structurally, visually, and behaviorally identical where applicable. This prompt must run until completion, crew by crew, fixing regressions, missing wiring, missing UI, and missing missions.

Speedster is the **only source of truth**. If a crew deviates from Speedster, it is wrong.

---

CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

1. Speedster = Canonical Reference

* Treat the current Speedster dashboard as the *gold standard*.
* All other crew dashboards must be refactored to match Speedster’s:

  * Top section consolidation
  * Ask integration
  * Mission Status with score
  * Missions presence
  * Metrics card style
  * Empty-state behavior

2. No Partial Compliance

* “Close enough” is a failure.
* If a crew does not match Speedster in structure, it must be fixed.
* If data exists but is not shown, that is a bug.
* If data does not exist, the UI must explicitly say so.

3. Long-Running, Crew-by-Crew

* This prompt is expected to run for an extended period.
* Do not stop early.
* Iterate through **every crew**, validate, fix, then move to the next.

---

STANDARD CREW DASHBOARD CONTRACT (MANDATORY)

Every crew dashboard must implement **all** of the following sections, in this order.

### 1) Unified Top Section (ONE CONTAINER)

This is where multiple crews are currently broken.

Must contain:

* Crew avatar (slightly larger, anchored left)
* Crew name
* Crew role / specialization
* “What this crew does” description
* Capability / monitor pills
* Top-right actions (refresh / settings if applicable)
* **Embedded Ask [CrewName] input**

  * Inline
  * Same placement and layout as Speedster
  * Label must say exactly: “Ask [CrewName]”

Rules:

* NO separate Ask widgets anywhere else.
* NO duplicate headers.
* NO extra blank containers beneath this section.
* If this section is split into two widgets → FIX IT.

If the crew cannot connect to its data source:

* Display a clear inline message:
  “Data not connected yet — configure integration to activate this crew.”
* Include a link to the correct configuration page.

---

### 2) Mission Status (REQUIRED FOR EVERY CREW)

Mission Status must exist for **every** crew, even if there is no data yet.

Must include:

* Left: **Score (0–100)**

  * Composite score derived from that crew’s primary metric(s)
  * Styled like Speedster
* Center:

  * Status label (Healthy / Needs Attention / Critical)
  * One-line explanation
* Right:

  * ONE yellow “Fix Everything” button (only here)

Rules:

* No “Go to next mission”
* No secondary CTAs
* No duplicate Fix Everything buttons elsewhere

If the crew cannot generate missions yet:

* Show “No automated fixes available yet”
* Still show the score (even if it’s provisional)

---

### 3) Missions (MUST ALWAYS EXIST)

This is where many crews are currently failing (Beacon, Hemingway).

Rules:

* Missions must always show *something actionable*.
* “No missions” is NOT acceptable if the crew’s purpose implies improvement.

If real missions exist:

* Show them.

If real missions do not yet exist:

* Generate **placeholder improvement missions** aligned to the crew’s purpose.

Examples:

* Beacon:

  * “Acquire high-quality backlinks”
  * “Improve referring domain diversity”
* Hemingway:

  * “Improve content quality score”
  * “Rewrite low-performing pages”
* Natasha:

  * “Identify competitive content gaps”

Mission Card Requirements:

* Button text must be **“Fix it”**
* No “Review”
* Clean card layout (no tag spam)
* At least one mission per crew

---

### 4) Metrics Section (Speedster Visual Style)

This is where Beacon and others are broken.

Rules:

* Key metrics must use the **Speedster glassy card style**:

  * Filled background
  * Clear numeric value
  * Subtle color accent
  * Optional bar/line indicator
* No plain text metrics.
* No mismatched card styles.

Examples:

* Beacon:

  * Authority
  * Backlinks
  * Referring Domains
  * Percentile
* Hemingway:

  * Content Quality Score
  * Pages Reviewed
  * Pages Needing Rewrite
* Pulse:

  * Conversion Rate
  * Bounce Rate
  * Sessions

If metrics exist in the API:

* Render them.

If metrics do not exist:

* Explicitly show:
  “Metric data unavailable — worker does not return this yet.”

---

### 5) Empty States & Connectivity (MANDATORY)

If a crew:

* Has no data
* Is not connected
* Has not run yet

You MUST:

* Show a clear explanation
* Show what action the user should take
* Link to the correct setup page

Never leave:

* Blank panels
* Skeletons with no explanation
* Silent failures

---

CREW-BY-CREW EXECUTION CHECKLIST

For EACH crew (Speedster, Natasha, Hemingway, Beacon, etc.):

1. Compare the dashboard to Speedster.
2. Identify ALL deviations:

   * Split top section
   * Missing Ask
   * Missing Mission Status
   * Missing score
   * Missing missions
   * Wrong metric card styles
   * Blank sections
3. Fix all deviations.
4. Verify:

   * Ask [CrewName] appears inline in top section
   * Mission Status has a score
   * Missions exist and are actionable
   * Metrics match Speedster’s visual language
5. Only then move to the next crew.

---

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (GLOBAL)

This task is complete ONLY when:

* All crew dashboards visually and structurally match Speedster
* All crews have:

  * Unified top section
  * Ask [CrewName]
  * Mission Status with score
  * At least one mission
  * Proper metric cards
* No crew has:

  * Blank panels
  * Split headers
  * Missing Ask labels
  * Missing missions
* Any missing data is explicitly explained

---

IMPORTANT NOTE

If you encounter uncertainty:

* Do NOT skip.
* Do NOT assume.
* Match Speedster.

Speedster is correct. Everything else must converge to it.
