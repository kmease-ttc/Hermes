Replit Prompt: Restyle Integrations Page to Match “My Crew” + Use Arclo Pro Button System

Objective
The Integrations page currently looks like a different product: the background, cards, and especially the purple buttons don’t match the Arclo Pro marketing style or the “My Crew” in-app aesthetic. Update Integrations so it feels like it belongs to the same dark, premium, ship-console UI as My Crew, while also using the Arclo Pro button styling for primary CTAs.

This is a styling + component alignment task. Do not change functionality.

Reference

* In-app target aesthetic: “My Crew” page (dark, glassy panels, soft glow, deep shadows, subtle gradients, premium spacing)
* Button system target aesthetic: Arclo Pro marketing site (rounded gradient purple buttons, clean pill shapes, strong hover/active states)

Requirements

1. Background + Page Shell (Match My Crew)

* Apply the same page background treatment used on My Crew:

  * Dark gradient background
  * Subtle vignette
  * Optional noise texture if used elsewhere
* Remove any lighter/flat backgrounds or mismatched canvas colors.
* Ensure the Integrations page header and content sit on the same dark shell as other pages.

2. Card / Panel System (Glass + Depth)
   Restyle all Integrations containers to use the My Crew “glass” pattern:

* Dark translucent backgrounds (e.g., black/indigo at ~30–60% opacity)
* Soft inner border (light stroke at low opacity)
* Subtle glow / shadow to separate layers
* Consistent corner radius (match My Crew)
* Increase spacing between sections instead of relying on thin dividers

Applies to:

* Site selector panel
* Service Inventory / Cards View container
* “Platform Dependencies” card
* Stats row tiles (Services/Built/Ready/etc.)
* Next Actions panel
* Ask Hermes panel
* Service table container

3. Buttons (Match Arclo Pro)
   Replace the current flat purple buttons with the Arclo Pro button style:
   Primary buttons to update:

* Run Daily Diagnosis
* Run QA
* Run Smoke Tests
* Test Connections
* Refresh (secondary)

Button system requirements:

* Primary = rounded pill + gradient purple (like Arclo Pro)
* Primary has:

  * subtle drop shadow
  * hover lift (translateY -1) + slightly stronger glow
  * active press (translateY +1) + reduced shadow
* Secondary = dark glass button with subtle border and hover glow (not purple fill)
* All buttons must have consistent height, padding, and font weight across the page.

Implementation detail:

* Create or update a shared button variant in your UI library:

  * e.g. `variant="arcloPrimary"` and `variant="arcloSecondary"`
* Replace per-page custom classes so Mission Control, My Crew, Integrations can share the same primitives.

4. Typography + Contrast

* Ensure headers are high-contrast (white/near-white)
* Subtitles and helper text should be muted but readable
* Increase contrast of table text (the service list) so it doesn’t feel washed out on the dark background
* Reduce “flat gray” text

5. Status Chips / Badges (Unify)

* Re-style status chips (Ready/Blocked/Never ran/etc.) to match the My Crew chip style:

  * softer fills
  * subtle border
  * consistent rounding
  * avoid harsh neon colors
* Keep semantic colors but make them premium and cohesive.

6. Table (Make it Premium)
   The service table should feel like a “console panel”:

* Put the table inside a glass container
* Add row hover highlight (subtle)
* Make column headers slightly brighter and tighter
* Ensure “Actions” chevron/arrow is consistent with other pages
