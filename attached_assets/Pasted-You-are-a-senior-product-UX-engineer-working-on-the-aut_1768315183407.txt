You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **authenticated Mission Control dashboard** (NOT the marketing site). The current design is clean but **not prescriptive enough**. Users still have to think about *what to do next*. Your job is to eliminate that hesitation.

This is a **priority + layout refactor**. We are not adding features — we are making the next action unavoidable.

---

## CORE PROBLEM TO SOLVE

Right now:

* “Fix Everything”
* “Website Report”
* “Developer Report”
* Email reporting (future)

…all exist, but they feel like **toolbar actions**, not **decisions**.

Users should not be choosing *what to click*.
The dashboard should **tell them what to do next**.

---

## NEW DASHBOARD MODEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### The dashboard must present **ONE primary decision**, not many equal buttons.

Reframe Mission Control as:

> **“Here’s what’s happening → Here’s what to do next → Here’s how you want us to handle it.”**

---

## LAYOUT CHANGE: INTRODUCE A “PRIMARY ACTION CARD ROW”

### At the TOP of Mission Control (below header, above Tasks)

Add a **3-card horizontal row**. These are NOT buttons — they are **decision cards**.

Each card:

* Full glass styling
* Same height
* Icon + title + short explanation
* One clear CTA
* One is visually dominant

---

## CARD 1 (PRIMARY, DOMINANT): FIX EVERYTHING FOR ME

This is the **default recommendation**. It must visually dominate.

### Visual treatment

* Slightly larger than the other two cards
* Strong glass background
* Subtle glow or border emphasis
* Primary gradient CTA

### Copy (example – adjust tone as needed)

**Title:** Fix Everything For Me
**Description:**
“Automatically fix the highest-impact issues across performance, SEO, and content. Safe mode enabled.”

**CTA (primary gradient):**

> Fix Everything Automatically

**Subtext (trust, small):**

> Safe mode • No destructive changes • Review before publish

### Behavior

* Clicking this triggers the execution flow:

  * If first time:

    * Choose execution method:

      * WordPress Plugin (free)
      * Move site to Arclo (paid)
      * Request another integration
  * If already configured:

    * Immediately queue fixes

This card should answer:

> “I don’t want to think. Just fix it.”

---

## CARD 2 (SECONDARY): WEBSITE REPORT (UNDERSTAND)

This is for users who want visibility, not action (yet).

### Visual treatment

* Same size as Card 3
* Glass styling
* Secondary accent CTA (NOT gradient)

### Copy

**Title:** Website Report
**Description:**
“Track how your site is performing today and over time. This powers your weekly email summary.”

**CTA (secondary accent):**

> View Website Report

This card answers:

> “Help me understand what’s going on.”

---

## CARD 3 (SECONDARY): DEVELOPER REPORT (SHARE)

This is for delegation.

### Visual treatment

* Same as Website Report
* Glass styling
* Secondary accent CTA

### Copy

**Title:** Developer Report
**Description:**
“A clean, shareable report with prioritized technical issues for your developer or agency.”

**CTA (secondary accent):**

> Generate Developer Report

This card answers:

> “I’ll have someone else handle this.”

---

## CRITICAL RULES FOR THIS ROW

* These cards replace scattered toolbar buttons.
* Remove or demote:

  * “Fix Everything” buttons in the header
  * Export-style wording
* This row is the **decision point** of the dashboard.

If the user scrolls past this without acting, that’s a failure.

---

## TASKS SECTION (BELOW THE CARD ROW)

Now that the decision is clear, **Tasks** become supporting evidence.

### Tasks section should:

* Clearly say:

  > “You have X tasks across Y systems”
* Show:

  * Top 3 tasks
  * Impact / effort
* Reinforce why “Fix Everything” is recommended

### Add one prescriptive line above tasks:

> “We recommend fixing these automatically to prevent further traffic loss.”

---

## EMAIL REPORTING (IMPORTANT BUT NOT PRIMARY)

Email reporting is **NOT a primary action** on first view.

### Placement

* Mentioned inside:

  * Website Report card
  * Settings later
* NOT a top-level CTA card on day one

Reason:

* It’s passive
* It doesn’t resolve urgency

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (THIS IS HOW YOU KNOW IT WORKED)

Before finishing, verify:

* The **first thing the user sees** is a large “Fix Everything For Me” card
* There is **one clearly recommended path**
* Other options exist but are clearly secondary
* No toolbar-style clutter competing for attention
* A non-technical user knows exactly what to do in <5 seconds

If you still feel “maybe I should click this instead” — it’s not prescriptive enough.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE (DO NOT IGNORE)

> **Dashboards inform. Products decide.**

This page must decide *with* the user, not present options neutrally.

Make the right choice obvious.
Make the safe choice comforting.
Make the manual choice still respected — but secondary.

Implement this first-class action row before anything else.
