Absolutely. Below is a redesigned landing page that will feel lighter, convert better on mobile, and set you up cleanly for the free report funnel — plus explicit implementation instructions your dev team can follow.

⸻

Redesigned Landing Page Goals
	1.	Reduce cognitive load above the fold
	2.	Get more users to enter URL + click
	3.	Add trust without heaviness
	4.	Make it obvious there’s a free report and a path to autopilot
	5.	Keep the page fast (no bloat)

⸻

New Page Structure (Mobile-first)

Above the fold (Hero)

Header
	•	Left: Arclo logo + wordmark
	•	Right: “Log in” (secondary)

Hero content
	•	H1: short outcome
	•	One sentence subheadline
	•	URL input + CTA
	•	One line microcopy that reduces friction

Trust row (tiny, 3 items)
	•	“No credit card”
	•	“30–60 seconds”
	•	“Private by default”

Copy (use this)

H1: SEO on Autopilot
Sub: Run a free scan to see what’s hurting your traffic — and what to fix first.
Input placeholder: Enter your website (example.com)
Button: Run Free Scan
Microcopy: No signup required • Takes ~60 seconds

⸻

Section 2: What you get (3 cards)

Three simple cards with plain-English outcomes.

Card 1: Diagnosis
	•	“Top issues holding back traffic”

Card 2: Prioritized Fixes
	•	“What to fix first, and why”

Card 3: Competitive Snapshot
	•	“Who’s outranking you and where”

Keep each card to 1 line title + 1 line description.

⸻

Section 3: “Show me” (Report Preview)

A lightweight “report preview” panel (static mock is fine for v1).

Left: screenshot/mock
Right: bullets:
	•	SEO Health Score
	•	Top 3 Issues
	•	Keyword opportunities
	•	Technical + speed flags

Add a small note:
	•	“This is a sample preview — your report will be specific to your site.”

⸻

Section 4: The 3 ways to use Arclo (simple choices)

This section makes monetization feel natural without pushing pricing yet.

DIY (Free)
	•	“Get the report + hand the plan to your dev.”

Autopilot (Recommended)
	•	“Arclo monitors and deploys fixes safely.”

Done-for-you
	•	“We can build/host/manage your site if needed.”

Each card has a single CTA:
	•	DIY: “See what’s included”
	•	Autopilot: “How Autopilot works”
	•	Done-for-you: “Talk to us”

No pricing displayed on homepage (keep it for deploy moment).

⸻

Section 5: Founder trust line (short)

One tight paragraph. No wall of text.

Copy:
Arclo was built after replacing multiple SEO agencies for a real medical practice. We turned the workflow that increased leads and reduced costs into automation — so you can focus on your business, not SEO.

	•	Contact
	•	Copyright

⸻

Interaction Rules

URL input behavior
	•	Accept example.com, www.example.com, https://example.com
	•	Normalize to https://
	•	On submit:
	•	Show inline progress state on the button (“Scanning…”)
	•	Route to scan status / preview page

Hero CTA should remain visible
	•	On mobile, keep the hero compact enough that the input + button are visible without scroll.

⸻

Performance / “Feels Heavy” Fixes

Your current page feels heavy mainly because of text density, but also make sure the dev team implements:
	1.	Do not load app dashboard code on /
	•	Landing page bundle should be minimal
	2.	Use static sections
	•	No heavy animation libs
	3.	Avoid large background effects
	•	Keep gradients but no particle effects
	4.	Preload only critical fonts
	•	Use system fonts or 1 webfont max

⸻

Dev Team Implementation Instructions (Explicit)

1) Routing / app separation
	•	/ = new marketing landing page (public)
	•	/login = auth
	•	/app/* = mission control (authenticated)
	•	/scan/* and /report/free/* = funnel pages (public/read-only)

Critical: do not mount the entire app shell on /.

⸻

2) Components to build

Create these components (or equivalent):
	•	LandingHero
	•	TrustRow
	•	BenefitCards
	•	ReportPreview
	•	ThreeWaysCards
	•	FounderNote
	•	LandingFooter

Each should be a small, presentational component.

⸻

3) Page layout specs

Spacing
	•	Mobile padding: 20–24px
	•	Section spacing: 32–48px
	•	Max width on desktop: 1040–1120px

Typography
	•	H1: 36–44px mobile, 56–64px desktop
	•	Subheadline: 16–18px mobile, 18–20px desktop
	•	Keep line-length tight (no paragraph wider than ~60–70 chars per line)

Button / input
	•	Input height: 48–52px
	•	Button height: match input
	•	URL field + CTA stacked on mobile, inline on desktop

⸻

4) Copy implementation (do not improvise v1)

Hardcode v1 copy exactly as above so we can A/B test later.

⸻

5) CTA wiring

Hero CTA calls existing scan kickoff:
	•	POST /api/scan with normalized URL
	•	On success:
	•	route to /scan/preview/:scanId (or your current equivalent)
	•	Show errors inline:
	•	“Please enter a valid website.”

Track these events:
	•	landing_cta_click
	•	scan_started
	•	scan_error

⸻

6) Accessibility requirements
	•	Input has a label (can be visually hidden)
	•	Button has proper focus states
	•	Color contrast meets WCAG AA
	•	All sections navigable by keyboard

⸻

7) Acceptance criteria

Landing page is approved when:
	•	On iPhone-sized screen, user sees:
	•	H1, subheadline, input, button without scrolling
	•	Page loads fast and does not feel like the full app
	•	Copy is short and scannable (no big paragraph above fold)
	•	CTA triggers scan successfully

If you want, I can also write a second variant that’s even more aggressive (more “anti-agency”) for A/B testing — but the above is the clean conversion-focused redesign that will immediately reduce the “heavy and wordy” feel.
