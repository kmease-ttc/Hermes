Arclo Pro Services

* Hermes This is the main web app and control center. It hosts the dashboard, lets you add and switch websites, shows findings and trends, displays suggested actions, and provides an audit trail of every run and change. It also owns the “reasoning” layer that turns raw data into a diagnosis (what changed, likely cause, and recommended fixes), and it coordinates calls to the worker services.

* Orchestrator / Job Runner This runs scheduled jobs (daily/weekly/on-demand) across all connected services, handles retries/rate limits/timeouts, and writes run status plus results back to the database. In early phases it can live inside AI Doctor Core, but it should be implemented as a distinct module with a clean interface so it can be split into its own service later for multi-tenant scaling.Website Registry & Settings This is the system that stores per-website configuration and policies: base domain, competitor list, Search Console property, GA4 property ID, crawl limits, run frequency, and “safe mode” settings. It enables AI Doctor to be multi-site from the start by letting every worker service operate using a website_id and pulling the right settings and credentials for that site.

* Google Data Connector (GSC + GA4) This service handles Google OAuth, token storage/refresh, and exposes clean endpoints to fetch Search Console and GA4 data for a specific website_id. It provides the first-party truth layer—impressions, clicks, CTR, position, queries, pages, sessions, users, landing pages—so AI Doctor can detect drops, correlate them with behavior, and track whether fixes improved performance.

* Crawl & Render Service (Technical SEO) This service crawls a site and produces a structured technical SEO report: status codes, redirects, canonicals, indexability, internal links, orphan pages, sitemap/robots checks, and other crawl health indicators. It also performs render checks to validate what a bot sees on JS/Node pages (detecting blank content, missing critical text, or hydration failures). The output is a normalized list of findings and suggested technical actions for AI Doctor to display and prioritize.

* Core Web Vitals & Performance Monitor This service pulls performance signals (via PageSpeed Insights/CrUX or Lighthouse-style checks) for key URLs and tracks changes over time in LCP/CLS/INP and related metrics. It flags regressions that may explain ranking or conversion drops and provides URL-level “what worsened” summaries so AI Doctor can recommend targeted performance fixes.

* Competitive Snapshot Service This service captures a baseline view of competitors for a website: who they are, what pages they rank with, what those pages look like (titles/meta/H1 structure), and how their URL structures and page templates are organized. In early phases it can be lightweight and read-only, but it ensures competitor context is present from day one so AI Doctor can compare your site against what’s winning in the market.

* SERP & Keyword Intelligence Service This service generates and maintains the “Top 100 Keywords to Rank For” list, tracks ranks over time, and collects SERP snapshots (top results, volatility, and basic SERP feature presence). It feeds AI Doctor keyword opportunities (quick wins and strategic targets), plus a view of where competitors outrank you so the system can connect traffic drops to actual ranking changes.

* Competitive Intelligence & Content Gap Service This service analyzes why competitors win for shared keywords by comparing competitor pages against your relevant pages. It identifies missing sections, weak coverage, missing FAQs, schema differences, internal linking differences, and SERP-feature-specific requirements (e.g., snippet/PAA targeting). It produces actionable gap reports AI Doctor can turn into recommended page updates or content briefs.

* Content Decay Monitor This service identifies your pages that are losing impressions/clicks/rank over time and detects when competitors have replaced you in the SERPs. It outputs prioritized “refresh candidates” with likely reasons for decay and recommended refresh actions (update sections, expand coverage, add FAQs/schema, improve internal links). This is a key trigger for ongoing maintenance rather than only net-new content creation.

* Content Generator (Blogs + Pages + Refresh Drafts) This service produces draft content (new blog posts, new service pages, and refresh rewrites) based on keyword intent, competitor gap findings, and your knowledge base rules. It outputs structured drafts and content blocks (FAQ, schema snippets, headings, internal link targets) so content can be reviewed, validated, and then published safely via the executor.

* Content QA / Policy Validator This service enforces your best-practice ruleset and medical/E-E-A-T/compliance checks. It scores content, flags violations (structure, thin content, missing disclaimers, missing FAQ/schema, over-optimization, etc.), and returns a fix list. AI Doctor uses this to gate publishing and to ensure everything generated or edited meets your standards.

* Backlink & Authority Signals Service This service integrates with a backlink data provider to track new/lost links, domain authority proxies, anchor text, and link velocity, and it compares those signals to competitors. It helps AI Doctor explain “we’re losing because authority is weaker” vs “we’re losing because the page is weaker,” and it provides inputs for prioritizing link-building or PR-style actions.

* Site Change Executor (Safe Apply / GitHub PR / CMS API) This service is responsible for safely applying approved changes to the live website, ideally via a GitHub PR workflow that produces diffs, supports review/approval, and enables rollback. It should support a “dry run” mode, capture before/after snapshots, and log every applied change so AI Doctor has a reliable audit trail and you can trust automation at scale.

* Audit Log & Observability Service This service stores run history, service health, job outcomes, and change logs across the entire system, enabling you to trace any recommendation back to inputs and see what actually changed. It also powers alerts (run failed, API quota hit, big traffic drop, indexing issue detected) and becomes essential once you scale beyond a single site into ArcGlow Pro.

* Notifications Service This service sends alerts and summaries via email/SMS/Slack-style notifications: daily diagnosis summaries, critical drops, indexing emergencies, crawl failures, and “approval needed” prompts for high-risk changes. It ensures the system is operationally useful without requiring you to log into the dashboard constantly.
