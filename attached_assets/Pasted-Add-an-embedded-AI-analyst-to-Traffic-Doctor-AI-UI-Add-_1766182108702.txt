Add an embedded AI analyst to Traffic Doctor AI.

UI
	•	Add a new tab or side panel labeled “Ask Traffic Doctor AI”.
	•	Include:
	•	Multiline text input for a user question
	•	Submit button (“Ask”)
	•	Scrollable response area that supports markdown
	•	Styling can be minimal.

Backend
	•	Add a new backend endpoint:

POST /ai/ask

Request body:
{
“question”: “string”
}

Behavior:
	•	Load the latest completed run from the database:
	•	report markdown
	•	tickets JSON
	•	source/status summary (GA4, Search Console, Ads, website checks)
	•	Construct a prompt for the OpenAI API using:
	•	A system instruction defining the assistant as Traffic Doctor AI
	•	The latest report markdown
	•	The latest tickets JSON
	•	The source/status summary
	•	The user’s question
	•	Call the OpenAI API server-side.
	•	Return the AI response as plain text or markdown.

System Prompt
Use a system prompt equivalent to:

“You are Traffic Doctor AI, an expert at diagnosing web traffic and advertising performance issues. You have access to the latest system analysis, metrics, and recommended fixes below. Answer the user’s question using only this data. Be concrete, actionable, and prioritize the highest-impact fixes. If data is missing or inconclusive, say so explicitly.”

Security
	•	Store the OpenAI API key in Replit Secrets.
	•	Do not expose the API key to the frontend.
	•	All OpenAI calls must be made server-side.

Performance
	•	Use only the latest run as context.
	•	Truncate or summarize long sections if needed to stay within token limits.
	•	Set reasonable max tokens for responses.

Optional (Recommended)
	•	Log each question and AI response to the database.
	•	Associate each interaction with the run ID used for context.
	•	Add basic error handling for cases where no completed run exists (return a clear message).

Frontend Integration
	•	The Ask button should call POST /ai/ask with the user’s question.
	•	Render the response returned by the backend in the response area.
	•	Disable the Ask button and show a loading state while the request is in progress.
