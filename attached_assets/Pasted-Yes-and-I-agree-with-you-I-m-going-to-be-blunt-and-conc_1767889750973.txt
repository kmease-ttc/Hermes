Yes — and I agree with you. I’m going to be blunt and concrete so you can actually fix this, not “polish it.”

Right now this page still looks like **a product spec dressed up as marketing**. Even though the colors and icons are better, the **structure, density, and copy rhythm are wrong for a consumer-facing, hands-off service**.

Below is a **full redesign** you can implement directly. This is not theory — it’s a replacement.

---

## Why it still looks bad (plain English)

1. **Too much explanation, too early**
   Users are forced to read paragraphs to understand value. Consumer pages should work even if someone skims.

2. **The page is vertically empty but cognitively heavy**
   There’s white space, but every section still demands attention and interpretation.

3. **It still feels like “how the system works,” not “why I should trust it”**
   Consumers don’t care *how*. They care *that it’s handled*.

4. **Icons are floating without emotional weight**
   They’re better stylistically, but they don’t *replace reading*.

---

## The Correct Mental Model

This page should feel like:

> “Oh… I don’t have to do anything. This just runs.”

Not:

> “Let me understand these steps.”

If someone scrolls this page for 10 seconds, they should walk away with **one belief**:

> “SEO is no longer my problem.”

---

## HARD RESET: New Page Structure (Use This)

### SECTION 1 — Kill the intro paragraph

❌ Delete any paragraph explaining *how* things work.

✅ Replace with this:

**Headline (large, dark, simple)**

> SEO that runs on autopilot

**Subhead (one sentence max)**

> Hermes finds issues, fixes them automatically, and keeps your site optimized — without you reviewing reports or making decisions.

That’s it. No more.

---

### SECTION 2 — One reassurance block (this stays)

You already have this — it’s the **best thing on the page** — but it’s buried and understated.

**Make this the anchor:**

> ✅ No work required
> Hermes runs automatically in the background. You’ll only hear from us when something improves — or if action is needed.

Make this:

* Full width
* Slightly darker border
* Visually heavier than the rest of the page

This is your trust builder.

---

### SECTION 3 — Replace “steps” with outcome cards

Delete the vertical step flow.
Delete paragraphs.

Replace with **three horizontal cards** that read in 3 seconds total.

#### Card 1

**Headline**

> We find what’s broken

**One line**

> Continuous scans catch technical issues, content gaps, and missed opportunities.

(No SEO jargon. No “senior SEO would run” nonsense.)

#### Card 2

**Headline**

> We fix it automatically

**One line**

> Hermes applies proven fixes in the background — no approvals, no reviews required.

This is the money line.

#### Card 3

**Headline**

> Your traffic improves

**One line**

> Rankings, performance, and content improve over time while you focus on your business.

That’s it.
No bullets. No sub-paragraphs.

---

### SECTION 4 — Explicitly remove responsibility from the user

This is missing, and it’s critical.

Add a section that literally says:

**Headline**

> You don’t need to review SEO reports

**Body (2 lines max)**

> Hermes generates reports for transparency — not for decision-making.
> You can ignore them entirely and let everything run automatically.

This is **consumer best practice**. Spell it out.

---

### SECTION 5 — Tie it to the “Fix it” button

This page must reinforce your core differentiator.

Add a simple CTA block:

**Headline**

> Want to be hands-off? One click does it.

**Primary button**

> Fix my SEO automatically

**Secondary (text link)**

> See what will change

This closes the loop between promise and action.

---

## Visual Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Apply these or it will still look wrong:

1. **One sentence per block**
   If it wraps to three lines, it’s too long.

2. **Icons ABOVE text, not beside it**
   Icons are anchors, not decorations.

3. **No paragraphs longer than 2 lines anywhere**
   This is marketing, not documentation.

4. **Headlines do the work, body copy just reassures**

---

## What to DELETE (Important)

Delete or permanently move elsewhere:

* “The same checks a senior SEO professional would run”
* Any explanation of *process*
* Any implication the user should understand SEO
* Any multi-bullet explanations

Those belong in:

* A blog post
* A help doc
* A “Technical details” page

Not here.

---

## Why This Fixes It

After this redesign:

* The page scans in under 10 seconds
* The user feels *relief*, not curiosity
* The icons support meaning instead of clutter
* The product feels like a **service**, not software

That is consumer best practice.

---

## If you want next (I recommend this)

I can:

* Rewrite the **exact JSX/HTML** for this page
* Redesign it as a **single-column mobile-first layout**
* Compare it side-by-side with high-converting consumer SaaS pages
* Tighten copy even further (this can be sharper)

But you were right to call it out — this wasn’t a color or icon problem.
It was a **structural UX problem**, and now you have a clean fix.
