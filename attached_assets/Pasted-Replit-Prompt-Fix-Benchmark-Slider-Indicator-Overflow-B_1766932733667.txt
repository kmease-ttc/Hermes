Replit Prompt: Fix Benchmark Slider Indicator Overflow (Blue Dot Escaping Track)

Problem
The benchmark slider’s indicator dot (blue circle) can render partially or fully outside the track/container when the value is near the edges (e.g., close to P25 or below). This breaks visual containment and looks like a layout bug.

Goal
Ensure the indicator dot is always visually contained within the slider track/frame, regardless of value.

Root cause (likely)

* The dot is positioned using a percentage-based `left` transform without clamping.
* The dot’s radius isn’t accounted for, so at low/high percentages it overflows the track bounds.
* The track container doesn’t clip overflow.

What to fix (implementation guidance)

1. Clamp the indicator position
   When computing the indicator’s horizontal position:

* Clamp the value so it never reaches true 0% or 100%.
* Offset by half the dot’s width.

Example logic (conceptual):

* minPosition = dotRadius
* maxPosition = trackWidth - dotRadius
* computedX = clamp(rawX, minPosition, maxPosition)

If using percentages:

* Clamp to something like 2%–98% instead of 0–100%, OR
* Convert to px-based positioning using track width.

2. Ensure the track clips overflow

* The slider track container should have:

  * `overflow-hidden`
  * consistent border-radius
    This ensures even if positioning math drifts slightly, nothing can escape the visual frame.

3. Account for dot size explicitly

* Do not assume the dot is negligible.
* Use the actual rendered size (e.g., 10–12px radius).
* If the dot size is themeable, derive radius from a constant.

4. Verify transform origin
   If using transforms like `translateX(-50%)`:

* Make sure it’s applied consistently.
* Avoid double-offsets (e.g., left % + translate that pushes it out again).

5. Test edge cases
   Verify visually for:

* Very low values (near P25 or below)
* Very high values (near P90)
* Midpoint (P50)
  The dot should always:
* Sit fully on the bar
* Never touch or cross the rounded ends
* Feel centered relative to its value

Do not change

* Do not change the color, size, or style of the dot.
* Do not change the benchmark labels or scale.
* This is a containment/positioning fix only.

Acceptance criteria

* The indicator dot is always fully visible inside the slider track.
* No overflow outside the rounded container at any value.
* The fix works responsively at different widths.
* No visual regression to the glass styling or gradient bar.
