You are a senior product engineer working in the Hermes SEO / Arclo codebase.

Goal
Fully flesh out **Draper (Paid Ads / Campaign Optimization)** to match the completeness and polish of Scotty/Sentinel/Hemingway, **WITHOUT** hooking up the Draper worker yet. Build the UI, data model, stubs, and wiring so that when the worker is connected later, it drops in cleanly.

Constraints

* Do not call or depend on the Draper worker.
* No live Google Ads API calls from Draper page for now.
* Everything must render reliably with mock/stub data and proper empty states.

---

## Part A — KPI / Metrics section (top of page)

Use the standard KPI components and Draper crew accent color.

KPIs (render from stubbed “snapshot” data for now):

1. **Spend (7d)**

* currency, e.g. `$0` initially

2. **Conversions (7d)**

* integer, default 0

3. **CPA (7d)**

* currency, default `$0`

4. **ROAS (7d)**

* numeric, default `0.0x`

No blanks. Show `0` values until connected.

---

## Part B — Missions section

Draper missions should be visible and actionable, but actions should be “queued” locally until worker exists.

Missions (each should show description + “Fix” button):

1. **Campaign Review**

* “Identify underperforming campaigns, bad search terms, and missing negatives.”

2. **Spend Analysis**

* “Find wasted spend and reallocate budget.”

3. **Ad Copy Optimization**

* “Improve CTR and quality score with stronger messaging.”

4. **Landing Page Alignment**

* “Ensure ads route to the best matching page for conversion.”

When clicking “Fix”, do NOT call a worker.
Instead:

* Create a local “queued actions” system and add an entry to a queue list with status: `queued`.

---

## Part C — Tabs

Create tabs matching the pattern used elsewhere:

* Findings
* Next Steps
* Controls

### Findings (stubbed)

Show a table with realistic sample findings but clearly labeled as “Preview data (worker not connected)”.
Rows include:

* Issue type (e.g., “Wasted spend”, “Missing negatives”, “Low CTR ad group”)
* Scope (campaign/ad group)
* Impact estimate (Low/Med/High)
* Recommended action
* Fix button (queues action)

### Next Steps

Show a prioritized list of recommended actions (stubbed), each with:

* effort (S/M/L)
* impact (Low/Med/High)
* Fix button -> queues action

### Controls

Provide UI controls that will map to worker configs later:

* Target CPA input
* ROAS goal input
* Max daily spend cap
* Toggle: “Auto-apply negatives” (disabled for now)
* Toggle: “Pause low performers” (disabled for now)
  These should save to local DB config (see Part D), not call external APIs.

---

## Part D — Data model + stubs (prepare for worker)

1. Add DB tables (or extend existing) for Draper:

* `draper_settings`

  * customer_id (optional)
  * target_cpa
  * target_roas
  * daily_spend_cap
  * created_at, updated_at
* `draper_action_queue`

  * id
  * created_at
  * status: queued | running | done | failed
  * action_type
  * payload (json)
  * note (text)

2. Add API endpoints (local only, no worker):

* `GET /api/draper/settings`
* `POST /api/draper/settings`
* `GET /api/draper/actions`
* `POST /api/draper/actions`  (enqueue)
* `POST /api/draper/actions/:id/cancel` (optional)

3. Stub “snapshot” data provider (in server)

* `GET /api/draper/snapshot`
  Return defaults (all zeros) + sample fields structure that the worker will later populate.

---

## Part E — UI wiring

* Draper page should fetch:

  * snapshot (for KPIs)
  * settings (for Controls)
  * action queue (for Actions panel)

* Display a top banner:
  “Draper worker not connected — showing preview data. You can queue actions and configure targets now.”

* Ensure all sections render without errors even if APIs return empty.

---

## Part F — Quality + styling

* Match the standard KPI grid sizing, spacing, and accent line behavior.
* Fix buttons should behave like other agents:

  * on click: optimistic enqueue + toast
  * show in action queue list with status chip

---

## Acceptance criteria

* Draper page looks complete and consistent with the rest of the app.
* KPIs render with stable “0” data (no blanks).
* Missions + Findings + Next Steps can queue actions into DB.
* Controls persist to DB and reflect current values on reload.
* No worker dependency exists yet, but the API/data shapes are ready for later wiring.
