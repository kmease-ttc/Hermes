Replit Prompt: Systemic Design System Fix (Global Styling + Component Variants) — Make UI Changes Apply Across Entire App

Problem
Right now design changes are being applied page-by-page (local class tweaks) instead of through a shared design system. This causes inconsistent UI: some buttons update, others keep the old style (e.g., “Run Smoke Tests”), and some sections become unreadable (e.g., “Next Actions” looks invisible).

Goal
Implement a single, global design system so that changes to button styles, labels, cards, badges, and backgrounds automatically apply everywhere in the site, without having to manually restyle each page.

Non-negotiables

* One source of truth for common UI styling (buttons, cards, badges, pills, inputs, tables, alerts, sections).
* No per-page “random Tailwind class piles” for shared UI elements.
* Use a shared theme/token approach (CSS variables) so palette changes take effect globally.
* Replace “special one-off components” with variants of shared components.
* Ensure contrast/accessibility: anything important must be readable against the dark background.

What to build (step-by-step)

1. Create global theme tokens (CSS variables)
   Where: client/src/styles/globals.css (or whatever global stylesheet is already imported by the app)
   Add a token set for:

* surface backgrounds (page bg, panels, cards)
* border colors
* text colors (primary, muted)
* accent colors (primary purple, secondary gold, danger red, success green, info blue, pink)
* shadows/glow intensities
* button gradient (if used) as a token, not hardcoded

Example tokens (use your existing palette, not new random colors):
--bg, --panel, --card
--border, --border-strong
--text, --muted
--primary, --primary-2
--secondary
--danger
--success
--info
--pink
--ring
--glow

Then make sure base elements reference tokens:
body background, default text, borders, etc.

2. Standardize core UI components with variants
   Use shadcn-style components in client/src/components/ui (or wherever your UI kit lives).
   The core is:

* Button
* Card
* Badge / Pill
* Input / Select
* Table styles
* Alert (blockers / warnings)

For each, implement variants:
Button variants:

* primary (default)
* secondary
* ghost
* outline
* danger
* success
  Sizes: sm / md / lg
  States: hover, active, focus-visible, disabled, loading

Card variants:

* default glass
* highlighted (tinted completion style)
* warning/danger (tinted by danger)
* success (tinted by success)

Badge variants:

* neutral
* success
* warning
* danger
* info

Important:
Do NOT style buttons directly in pages anymore.
All buttons must be <Button variant="..."> from the shared component.
If any page uses <button className="...">, refactor it to use <Button>.

3. Enforce “no raw button” rule
   Search the repo for:

* "<button"
* "className=.*bg-"
* "rounded.*px-"
  Replace with:
* shared <Button />
* shared <Card />
* shared <Badge />
* shared <Input />

If a “button” must be custom (rare), it still must use the same classes exported by the Button component.

4. Fix current inconsistencies explicitly (prove the system works)
   Integrations page issues to fix immediately after refactor:

* “Run Smoke Tests” must use the exact same button component/variant as “Run QA” / “Run Daily Diagnosis”
* “Test Connections” should be a consistent secondary/outline variant
* Any other CTA in that area should align to the same system

“Next Actions” visibility issue:

* This section needs a shared component pattern:

  * a panel/card container with proper contrast
  * list rows that have visible background, border, and text
  * badges (P2/P4) that are readable
    Implement as:
* <Card variant="default"> wrapper
* list rows with a subtle surface background and border using tokens
* ensure text uses --text and muted uses --muted
  Goal: it must be clearly readable, not “white on white” or invisible.

5. Adopt a “theme-first” approach for color changes
   When the user wants to tweak “purple gradient” or button colors:

* Change only tokens in the theme (globals.css)
* Everything updates automatically (buttons, badges, highlighted cards, etc.)
  Avoid hardcoding a purple gradient into only two buttons.

6. Add a lightweight “Style Audit” dev helper (optional but recommended)
   Create a dev-only page or console warning that checks for:

* raw <button> usage outside UI components
* non-standard class patterns on buttons/cards
  This prevents regressions.

Acceptance criteria

* Change a primary button token (or Button variant styling) once and see the change everywhere across the app.
* Integrations page: all buttons are consistent (Run QA, Refresh, Run Daily Diagnosis, Test Connections, Run Smoke Tests).
* Next Actions section is readable and uses the same card/list styling system as the rest of the app.
* Mission Control, My Crew, Integrations all share the same card + button + badge language with no random deviations.
* No new per-page “design-only” changes; styling lives in theme tokens + UI components.

Deliverables

* Global theme tokens in global CSS
* Updated Button/Card/Badge components with variants
* Refactor pages to use shared components
* Fix Integrations buttons + Next Actions visibility using shared components only

Do this now
Start with:

1. Implement theme tokens
2. Standardize Button + Card + Badge
3. Refactor Integrations page (so we can visually confirm)
4. Refactor Mission Control and My Crew next
