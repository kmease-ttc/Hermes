You are working in the Replit project “Hermes SEO / Arclo”. The marketing homepage currently has a broken / missing footer and several sections have contrast regressions, but this task is ONLY to add a proper, production-quality website footer that matches the new “white + subtle cosmic gradient” design language.

GOAL
Create a real SaaS footer (not a CTA block). It must be clearly visible, high-contrast, responsive, accessible, and consistent with the Arclo gradient + pill/button styling used in the hero.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Footer must be present on the marketing homepage (and ideally all marketing pages using the same layout).
2) Footer sections:
   - Brand block (logo + “Arclo” + 1-line description)
   - Product links (Examples, How It Works, Pricing, Analyze, Generate)
   - Company links (Privacy, Terms, Security, Contact)
   - Resources links (Docs, Support, Changelog, Status) — if these pages don’t exist yet, use “#” but keep the structure.
3) Bottom bar:
   - “© {currentYear} Arclo. All rights reserved.”
   - Small inline legal links (Privacy, Terms)
4) Optional but recommended:
   - Social icons (X/Twitter, LinkedIn) as simple SVGs with accessible labels.
5) Visual style:
   - Background: white with subtle gradient wash (very faint purple/pink/orange), plus a thin top border.
   - Layout: max-width container aligned with the rest of the page.
   - Link styles: dark text with hover gradient underline or slight color shift; must be readable.
   - Typography: same as site (Inter-ish), headings slightly stronger.
   - Spacing: generous padding (top/bottom), not cramped.
   - Contrast: all footer text must be readable (no “white on white” issues).
6) Accessibility:
   - Use <footer> landmark
   - Link focus states (visible outline)
   - SVG icons have aria-label or sr-only text

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (DO THIS EXACTLY)
A) Create component:
   - src/components/marketing/SiteFooter.tsx

B) Create footer styles in the existing styles system:
   - Add footer styles to src/styles/marketingTheme.css OR src/styles/arclo-base.css (choose whichever is currently used for marketing page styling)
   - Prefer CSS variables already used (tokens), but if missing add minimal variables locally for footer only.

C) Wire it up:
   - Find the marketing homepage component (likely src/pages or src/components/landing/*).
   - Insert <SiteFooter /> at the very bottom after the FAQ/CTA section.
   - Ensure it renders on the page and doesn’t overlap.

D) QA
   - Desktop: footer shows 4 columns + brand block; bottom bar aligned.
   - Mobile: stacks vertically with good spacing.
   - Check focus outlines + hover states.

DELIVERABLES
- Commit-ready code changes only (no pseudocode).
- If any referenced page routes don’t exist, keep href as “#” for now but maintain structure.

NOW IMPLEMENT IT.
