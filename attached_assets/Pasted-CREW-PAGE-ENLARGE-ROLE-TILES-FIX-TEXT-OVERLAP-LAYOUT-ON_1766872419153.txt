CREW PAGE – ENLARGE ROLE TILES + FIX TEXT OVERLAP (LAYOUT ONLY)

Context:
The ship layout and role semantics are correct. The remaining issue is SCALE and SPACING.
Crew tiles are too small, text is colliding with frames, and empty role slots feel cramped.

Goal:
Make all crew tiles and empty role frames noticeably larger, ensure all labels fit cleanly inside frames, and eliminate any overlap between tiles.

This is a layout and sizing pass only. Do NOT change logic, roles, or interactions.

### 1) TILE SIZE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Increase the size of ALL role tiles (filled and empty).

Target sizing:
- Default crew tile size: **160–180px square** on desktop
- Major Tom may remain slightly larger (up to ~190px), but NOT dramatically different
- Empty role slots must be the SAME SIZE as filled slots

Implementation guidance:
- Replace any hard-coded sizes (e.g., 120px, 132px) with a larger value
- Prefer responsive sizing:
  - width/height: clamp(140px, 14vw, 180px)

Result:
- Bots appear large and prominent
- Frames feel intentional, not cramped

### 2) TEXT & BADGE CONTAINMENT (CRITICAL FIX)

Fix all cases where:
- “Active” badge overlaps the avatar
- Crew name sits outside or below the frame
- Empty slot labels spill outside the frame

Rules:
- Crew name MUST appear inside the frame
- Badge (Active / Included) must not overlap avatar
- Empty slot text (“Empty slot”, role name) must fit inside the frame

Recommended internal layout (top → bottom):
- Top-right: status badge (small, inset)
- Center: bot avatar (largest element)
- Bottom: crew name OR “Empty slot” text (muted)

No text should render outside the tile bounds.

### 3) EMPTY SLOT FRAMES

Empty role slots must:
- Use the same frame size as filled slots
- Show:
  - Role icon (centered)
  - Role name (inside frame)
  - Info “i” icon
- Use dashed or subtle border to differentiate from filled slots

Do NOT shrink empty slots.

---

### 4) SPACING & NON-OVERLAP (VERY IMPORTANT)

Eliminate all overlap between tiles.

Minimum spacing:
- Horizontal gap: **32px**
- Vertical gap: **40px**

Implementation guidance:
- Spread tiles further apart using x/y percentage adjustments
- Use more vertical real estate — do not compress to fit above fold
- It is OK if the ship becomes taller

Acceptance rule:
- At desktop widths ≥ 1280px, NO tiles may overlap under any condition

---

### 5) SHIP CANVAS REAL ESTATE

We have unused space on the left and right of the ship.

Rules:
- Expand tile positions outward slightly to use available horizontal space
- Do NOT keep all tiles tightly centered
- Maintain symmetry where possible

The ship should feel spacious and balanced, not stacked.

---

### 6) WHAT NOT TO CHANGE

- Do NOT change role list
- Do NOT change click behavior
- Do NOT change modals or tooltips
- Do NOT move Mission Status or lower sections
- Do NOT add new UI elements

This is a pure sizing and spacing pass.

---

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete when:
- All crew bots are visually larger and easier to read
- All text and badges fit cleanly inside frames
- Empty role slots match filled slot size
- No frames overlap
- The ship feels spacious, calm, and intentional
