You are working in a Replit project (Hermes SEO / Arclo). Implement the new white landing page hero design using the provided zip file: `arclo-white-home-hero-files.zip`.

Goal
- Make the homepage (route “/”) match the clean white hero mock:
  - High contrast headline + subhead
  - CTA row: input + primary gradient button
  - Secondary button: “Generate a Free Website”
  - Trust factors row as pill badges (high visibility)
  - Premium clean SaaS spacing + typography (Inter)
- This should NOT break the dashboard or app routes.

Implementation Steps
1) Unzip `arclo-white-home-hero-files.zip`.
2) Copy files into the repo exactly matching these paths:
   - `src/pages/landing/WhiteHero.tsx`
   - `src/pages/landing/LandingPage.tsx`
   - `src/styles/arclo-tokens.css`
   - `src/styles/arclo-base.css`
   - `src/styles/marketingTheme.css`
   - `README_APPLY.md`
3) Ensure global CSS loads the 3 new stylesheet imports FIRST.
   - In `src/index.css` (or whichever global stylesheet is loaded in `main.tsx`), add at the very top:
     @import "./styles/arclo-tokens.css";
     @import "./styles/arclo-base.css";
     @import "./styles/marketingTheme.css";
   - Make sure there are no duplicate imports of these three files elsewhere.
4) Wire the landing page to the root route `/`:
   - Find the router config (likely `src/App.tsx` or `src/pages/...`).
   - Ensure “/” renders `<LandingPage />`.
   - Do not change dashboard routes like `/app/dashboard`.
5) Confirm the hero matches these copy requirements EXACTLY:
   Headline:
   “Autonomous SEO that grows traffic — without guesswork.”
   Subheadline:
   “Weekly fixes you can approve, apply, and track.”
   Steps line:
   “Scan your site → Identify what’s holding rankings back → Apply fixes week-by-week”
   CTA:
   - Input placeholder: “Enter your website (example.com)”
   - Primary button: “Analyze My Website”
   - Secondary button: “Generate a Free Website”
   Microcopy:
   “Free scan • No credit card • Takes ~60 seconds”
   Trust pills:
   “Built for service businesses” / “Cancel anytime” / “Your changes logged” / “SEO best practices, automated”
6) Validate contrast:
   - No washed-out text
   - The “traffic” word has a subtle gradient highlight
   - Trust pills readable on white background
7) Run the app and visually confirm:
   - `/` looks like the white premium mock
   - No layout shift / nav spacing issues
   - Dashboard (`/app/dashboard`) still works unchanged

Deliverables
- Commit changes
- Reply with:
  - List of modified/added files
  - Confirmation that `/` is updated
  - Screenshot or description of the updated page

Constraints
- Keep changes minimal and localized to landing/marketing UI.
- Do not refactor unrelated components.
- Do not change business logic, auth, or API calls.
