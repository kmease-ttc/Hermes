You are a senior product + UX engineer refining the **Capabilities & Performance** section. The consolidation is correct, but the **visual execution regressed**: the old KPI widgets were stronger than the current “naked crew” cards. Your task is to **merge the old KPI widget visual language into each capability card**, while preserving the new unified model.

This is a **visual hierarchy + state handling refactor**, not a data change.

---

## CORE PROBLEM (WHAT’S WRONG RIGHT NOW)

1. The **old KPI cards looked better**:

   * Clear hero metric
   * Strong glow
   * Immediate value signal

2. The new capability cards:

   * Feel flatter
   * KPI is present but not *celebrated*
   * Some cards (e.g., Draper) lack glow entirely
   * Paid-but-not-setup states are unclear

The result:

> “I see agents” instead of “I see performance”.

---

## CORE DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

**Every capability card must visually contain a KPI widget inside it.**

Think of each card as:

> *Old KPI card + agent context + tasks + trend*

Not:

> *Agent card with some numbers*

---

## PART 1 — Reintroduce the KPI WIDGET inside capability cards

### KPI widget placement (non-negotiable)

Inside each capability card, add a **distinct KPI sub-panel** that visually matches the old Key Metrics cards.

Structure (top → bottom):

1. **Card Header**

   * Agent avatar
   * Agent name
   * Status badge (Active / Locked / Setup)

2. **KPI WIDGET (NEW, PROMINENT)**

   * Slightly inset panel
   * Strong glow
   * Large metric
   * Clear label
   * This is the focal point of the card

3. **Trend + Tasks**

   * Trend indicator (Improving / Stable / Declining)
   * “X tasks open”

4. **CTA**

   * Review / Enable / Configure

The KPI widget should be visually separable from the rest of the card (padding, background, glow).

---

## PART 2 — KPI WIDGET VISUAL SPEC (MATCH OLD KPI CARDS)

For each KPI widget:

* Background:

  * Dark glass panel
* Border:

  * Subtle but visible
* Glow:

  * Uses the **agent’s color**
  * Same glow strength as old KPI cards
* Metric:

  * Large, bold, centered
  * Agent color
* Label:

  * Small, muted
  * Explains metric

This should feel **identical in quality** to the old Conversion Rate / Monthly Sessions cards.

---

## PART 3 — Ensure ALL cards have proper glow (bug fix)

### Draper issue (explicit fix)

* Draper currently has **no glow**
* This is incorrect

Rules:

* Active → full agent-color glow
* Setup required → agent-color glow at ~50% opacity
* Locked → very faint agent-color glow (10–20%)

No card should have *no* glow unless explicitly disabled (and none are).

---

## PART 4 — Paid but not set up = “Configure” (language + CTA)

For paid but not configured capabilities (e.g., Draper):

* Status badge:

  * **Setup Required** (gold)
* CTA:

  * **Configure** (not Enable, not Review)
* KPI widget:

  * Still visible
  * Marked as “Sample”
  * Explains what will unlock after setup

Example:

> “Configure to unlock conversion and CPA tracking”

This matches user expectations for paid tools.

---

## PART 5 — Locked (not paid) state refinement

Locked cards must:

* Still show KPI widget
* Use blurred or muted sample value
* Show “Sample” chip
* CTA = **Enable**

But visually:

* They should still look **premium**
* Not grey blocks
* Not broken

The KPI widget is the tease.

---

## PART 6 — Color consistency rules (STRICT)

* KPI widget glow = **agent color**
* Card border glow = same agent color (lighter)
* Trend colors:

  * Improving = green
  * Declining = red
  * Stable = neutral
* Status badges:

  * Active = green
  * Setup Required = gold
  * Locked = neutral

If any card breaks this, it’s wrong.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before finishing, verify:

* Every capability card contains a **clear KPI widget**
* KPI widget looks as strong as the old Key Metrics cards
* Draper now has a visible glow
* Paid-but-not-setup cards say **Configure**
* Locked cards still feel premium and enticing
* At a glance, the grid reads as:

  > “Performance dashboard”, not “agent list”

If the KPI widget is not the first thing your eye lands on, increase its prominence.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Metrics sell value. Agents explain how.**

Bring back the KPI gravity — that’s what made the old design work.
