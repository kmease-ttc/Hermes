To add a “next action” button for each keyword, you’ll need to extend the data table component that renders your rankings so that it includes an extra column with a button. When clicked, that button can call whatever logic you have to compute and execute the next recommended optimization for that keyword.

Conceptually:

1. **Define the action handler**
   Implement a function—say `performNextAction(keyword)`—that encapsulates the logic for determining and applying the next optimisation step (e.g. updating meta tags, creating new content, adjusting internal links). This function could call your existing recommendation service or API, then trigger the necessary changes.

2. **Add the button to each row**
   Modify your keyword grid component to include an additional cell with a button:

   ```jsx
   <table>
     <thead>…</thead>
     <tbody>
       {keywords.map((kw) => (
         <tr key={kw.term}>
           <td>{kw.term}</td>
           <td>{kw.rank}</td>
           {/* other columns */}
           <td>
             <button
               className="btn btn-primary"
               onClick={() => performNextAction(kw.term)}
             >
               Next Action
             </button>
           </td>
         </tr>
       ))}
     </tbody>
   </table>
   ```

   You can style the button minimally to keep the grid from feeling too crowded—e.g., use a compact size and a subtle icon instead of full text if space is tight.

3. **Address grid heaviness**
   If the page feels busy, consider:

   * Using a sticky header and horizontally scrollable container so the button column doesn’t squeeze other columns.
   * Employing tooltips or icons instead of text labels (e.g., a wrench icon that triggers the next action).
   * Allowing users to toggle the visibility of the action column if they don’t need it at all times.

By encapsulating the optimization logic behind a single function and exposing it through a small button in each row, you maintain a clean interface while providing direct control over keyword improvements.
