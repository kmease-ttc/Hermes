Replit Prompt: Make “Priority Actions” use the GOLD attention color scheme (match Blockers semantics)

Context
The “Priority Actions” panel is now correctly using the cold glass container, but its accent color is wrong. It’s currently purple-tinted, which reads as a primary/system surface. Priority Actions should instead read as **attention / action-required**, like Blockers.

Goal
Update the **Priority Actions panel** to use the **gold color scheme** consistently, matching the semantic role of “things you should act on next.”

What “gold color scheme” means (use existing tokens)
Use the same gold/yellow palette already used for:

* Blockers container
* “Watch” pills
* Attention/queue indicators elsewhere in the app

Specifically apply gold to:

1. Panel container accent

* The cold glass background stays the same
* The tint/overlay color should shift from purple → gold
* Border/glow should be gold-toned (low opacity, subtle)

2. Section header

* “PRIORITY ACTIONS” label/icon should be gold (not purple)
* Any leading icon should inherit the gold accent

3. Item ordering markers

* The numbered circles (1, 2, 3) should be gold-themed
* Keep contrast high; text remains readable

What should NOT change

* Do NOT recolor individual crew pills (Pulse, Lookout, Natasha, etc.) — those should remain crew-colored
* Do NOT change severity pills (High/Medium/Quick) — those stay semantic
* Do NOT change layout, spacing, or typography
* Do NOT affect Blockers (they are already correct)

Implementation guidance

* Reuse the same container variant used by Blockers, but allow a configurable “tone”:

  * tone="warning" or tone="attention" (gold)
* If a variant already exists (e.g., warning-soft), use that instead of creating new classes
* Avoid hardcoded yellow values; use the shared gold token

Acceptance criteria

* Priority Actions visually reads as an “attention queue,” not a neutral or primary section
* Gold accents clearly distinguish it from:

  * Purple (system / control)
  * Red (errors)
  * Crew-specific colors
* Side-by-side with Blockers, the two feel related but not identical:

  * Blockers = hard stop
  * Priority Actions = next best actions

Result
Priority Actions now sits in the correct visual hierarchy:
Gold (act now) → Red (blocked) → Purple (system) → Crew colors (ownership)

This is the *right* call, by the way. Gold here instantly communicates “focus here next,” and it keeps purple reserved for control/state instead of urgency.
