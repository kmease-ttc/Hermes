Here’s a reinforcement prompt you can paste directly into Replit. This one is tighter, more opinionated, and explicitly anchors to the Crew page consolidation pattern and the yellow/amber tint you’re calling out.

⸻

You are a senior ARCLO frontend engineer.

This task is a reinforcement + alignment pass on the Mission area consolidation. The goal is to ensure the new Mission widget visually and structurally matches the Crew page consolidated widget pattern and uses the yellow/amber attention tint consistently.

⸻

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Rebuild the Mission area as one consolidated widget that:
	•	Mirrors the Crew page consolidated card pattern
	•	Uses the same yellow/amber-tinted surface treatment used for “attention” states on the Crew page
	•	Feels visually related to Crew widgets, not a new concept

If this widget were moved between pages, it should look like it belongs to the same system.

⸻

VISUAL ALIGNMENT (CRITICAL)

1. Crew Page Parity

Use the Crew page consolidated widget as the visual reference for:
	•	Padding
	•	Section separation
	•	Typography hierarchy
	•	Subtle background tinting
	•	Internal layout rhythm

This is not a new layout invention — it is a Mission-flavored version of the Crew widget.

⸻

2. Yellow / Amber Attention Tint

The Mission widget MUST have the same yellow/amber-tinted glass surface used when something “needs attention”.

Rules:
	•	Tint is subtle, not bright
	•	Tint is in the background surface, not text
	•	Text remains neutral (white / muted gray)
	•	Accent icons, pills, and dividers can lean amber

Think: “quiet warning,” not “alert banner.”

⸻

3. Status Expression

Status should be expressed through:
	•	Tint
	•	Small pill
	•	Icon accents

NOT through:
	•	Full red backgrounds
	•	Aggressive contrast
	•	Large warning banners

Yellow/amber is the default when:
	•	Missions are open
	•	Blockers exist
	•	Diagnostics have not yet been run

Red is reserved only for explicit failure states, not for general “work to do”.

⸻

STRUCTURE (MATCH CREW WIDGET)

Single Card: MissionWidget

Header row
	•	Title: Missions
	•	Status pill (Good / Needs attention / Critical)
	•	Right-aligned actions:
	•	Primary: Run Diagnostics or Generate Plan
	•	Secondary (only if applicable): Fix Everything

Header spacing, font size, and icon usage should match Crew widgets.

⸻

Summary strip (same pattern as Crew)
	•	Left: Score badge (reuse existing)
	•	Center: “Next:” one-line guidance
	•	Right: {open} missions • {blockers} blockers

This strip should visually feel like the Crew “summary row”.

⸻

Content section
	•	Compact list of missions (max 3 visible)
	•	Same row height and density as Crew items
	•	Right-aligned action buttons (Fix it, Review, etc.)
	•	“View all” if more than 3

⸻

Blockers section (collapsible)
	•	Same collapsible treatment used elsewhere in Crew widgets
	•	Header: Blockers (N)
	•	Chevron toggle
	•	Inside: compact blocker rows with Fix action

Collapsed by default.

⸻

COLOR & STYLE RULES (REINFORCED)
	•	Use ARCLO semantic colors only
	•	Yellow/amber tint must match Crew page exactly
	•	No new gradients
	•	No bevels
	•	No 3D effects
	•	No thick borders
	•	No heavy shadows

If anything looks “new” or “special”, simplify it.

⸻

BEHAVIOR RULES
	•	“Next:” logic:
	•	If blockers exist → show top blocker
	•	Else if missions exist → show top mission
	•	Else → “All clear”
	•	Status pill logic matches existing Mission logic (do not change semantics)

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
	1.	Inspect the Crew page consolidated widget and reuse:
	•	Container styles
	•	Section spacing
	•	Collapsible patterns
	2.	Apply the same structure to the Mission widget.
	3.	Add the yellow/amber attention tint to the Mission widget surface when status ≠ Good.
	4.	Remove old Mission Status card and Critical card entirely.
	5.	Ensure the page now has one Mission widget.

⸻

FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

Before marking complete, confirm:
	•	This widget could live on the Crew page without looking out of place
	•	The yellow tint is subtle and consistent
	•	The layout is calmer and shorter than before
	•	No duplicated “status” information exists elsewhere on the page

If the widget feels louder than the Crew widget, it’s wrong.

⸻

If you want next:
	•	I can write a visual diff checklist (before/after)
	•	Or a CSS token map showing exactly where the yellow tint should come from
	•	Or a JSX skeleton that mirrors the Crew widget line-for-line
