Objective
Fix the **layout and visual alignment** of the Mission Status component on the Speedster dashboard so it looks intentional, balanced, and polished—especially after adding the Performance score to the left side.

Observed Problems

* The left “65 Performance” badge feels visually disconnected from the rest of Mission Status.
* Vertical alignment between:

  * the score badge
  * the “Mission Status / Needs attention” text
  * the supporting copy (“Vital in poor range”, “Next: …”)
    is off.
* The content feels left-heavy and slightly cramped, while the right-side “Fix Everything” button feels detached.
* Spacing and hierarchy don’t clearly communicate:

  * Score → Status → Guidance → Action

Required End State (Visual & Layout)

Mission Status should read **left → right** in a clean, horizontal flow:

[ Performance Score Badge ]  [ Status + Summary + Next Step ]  [ Fix Everything Button ]

Detailed Layout Rules

1. Performance Score Badge (Left)

* Keep it compact and vertically centered.
* Badge should include:

  * Large number (e.g., 65)
  * Small label “Performance” underneath or beside it.
* Use a fixed-width container so it doesn’t collapse or stretch.
* Align vertically to the center of the Mission Status card.

2. Status Content Block (Center)
   This block should be vertically stacked and left-aligned:

* Row 1:

  * “Mission Status” label
  * Status chip (e.g., “Needs attention”) inline with the label
* Row 2:

  * Short summary sentence (e.g., “1 vital in poor range”)
* Row 3:

  * “Next:” guidance line (lighter weight, secondary color)

Spacing rules:

* Clear vertical rhythm (small gap between rows, not compressed).
* Text should not appear vertically misaligned relative to the score badge.

3. Action Button (Right)

* “Fix Everything” button should be:

  * Vertically centered relative to the entire Mission Status card
  * Clearly separated from the text block with consistent padding
* Do not let the button float higher or lower than the score badge.

Implementation Guidance (CSS / Layout)

* Use a 3-column flex layout:

  * Left: score badge (fixed width)
  * Middle: status content (flex-grow)
  * Right: actions (auto width)
* Align items vertically with `align-items: center` at the top-level container.
* Internally, allow the center column to stack text with `flex-direction: column`.

Do NOT:

* Stack the score badge above the text.
* Let the score badge push the status text downward.
* Introduce new colors or typography styles.

Acceptance Criteria

* The Mission Status card feels visually balanced and intentional.
* The performance score clearly feels “part of” Mission Status, not bolted on.
* All elements are vertically aligned and readable at a glance.
* The layout matches the level of polish of the rest of the Speedster dashboard.
