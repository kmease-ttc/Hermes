Objective
Make two UI cleanups on the Speedster dashboard:

1. Remove the duplicate stack of Core Web Vitals cards (keep the “good” labeled cards you like).
2. Move the “Core Web Vitals Overview” controls (Run Vitals Scan, Export Fix Pack, last updated/source, status chip) into the **top Speedster header / top widget area**, in a way that can later be standardized across all crew dashboards.

Change 1 — Remove Duplicate Vitals Card Stack (Keep the Good Ones)
Current issue:

* LCP / CLS / INP cards appear twice (two stacks/rows).
* One set appears to be “proper cards” with labels, statuses, and consistent widget styling.
* The other set looks like an unlabeled/incorrect/legacy rendering (missing label / not a proper widget).

Required action:

* Keep ONLY the proper labeled cards (the ones with:

  * Clear title label (Largest Contentful Paint / Cumulative Layout Shift / Interaction to Next Paint)
  * A status badge (Good / Poor etc.)
  * The full card layout with threshold bar + explanation text)
* Remove the duplicate/legacy stack, specifically:

  * the stack/cards that do not have a label, do not look like the proper widget component, or are missing the complete card UI.
* There should be exactly ONE set of LCP/CLS/INP cards on the page.

Acceptance criteria:

* Only one LCP/CLS/INP card row remains.
* The remaining row is the “awesome” fully styled card set.
* No empty sections or duplicated content remain.

Change 2 — Promote “Core Web Vitals Overview” into the Top Speedster Header Area
Current issue:

* “Core Web Vitals Overview” appears as a standalone panel with:

  * Last updated / Source
  * Status chip (Needs Attention)
  * Buttons: Run Vitals Scan, Export Fix Pack

Required action:

* Move this functionality up into the top Speedster area (the top widget/header area for the dashboard).
* Keep the content, but restructure it as a “top actions + status strip” that lives directly under the Speedster header (or inside the header container).

What to include in the top strip:

* Status chip (Needs Attention / Good / etc.)
* Last updated + source
* Primary actions:

  * Run Vitals Scan
  * Export Fix Pack
* This strip must be compact and not push content too far down.

Important: Standardization requirement

* Implement this in a way that can be reused across all crew dashboards later.
* Create/extend a shared pattern (recommended):

  * `CrewTopActionsBar` (generic)
  * Props: `status`, `lastUpdated`, `source`, `primaryActions[]`, `secondaryActions[]`
* Speedster uses it now; other crews will adopt the same placement later.

Temporary rule (for now)

* It’s OK if only Speedster uses the top actions bar initially.
* But structure it so other crews can plug in their own actions without creating one-off layouts.

Acceptance criteria:

* The standalone “Core Web Vitals Overview” card is removed from the body.
* Its contents are visible near the very top of the Speedster dashboard (top widget area).
* Run Vitals Scan and Export Fix Pack still work.
* Status + last updated/source remain visible and correct.
* The resulting top section feels like a unified “Speedster top widget” that we can replicate for other crews.
