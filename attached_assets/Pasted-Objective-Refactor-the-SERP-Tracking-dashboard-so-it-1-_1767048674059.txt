Objective
Refactor the SERP Tracking dashboard so it:

1. Generates/maintains a canonical list of ~100 “target keywords we want to rank for”
2. Uses the SERP worker to fetch positions for those keywords
3. Lets the user review/edit/approve the keyword list (feedback loop)
4. Removes the “Top Ranking Keywords” section and relies on a single “All Keywords” table + KPI cards

Key Product Behavior (What the user should experience)
A) On first load (no keyword list saved yet)

* The page shows a setup state with a CTA: “Generate my target keywords”
* When clicked, the system generates ~100 target keywords (via AI or another agent), saves them, then runs SERP to fetch rankings.

B) On normal load (keyword list exists)

* The page loads instantly from saved keywords + last known SERP results.
* User can click “Quick Check” or “Full Check”:

  * Quick Check = only refresh keywords missing recent data (respect 7-day rule)
  * Full Check = refresh rankings for all keywords (still respect the 7-day rule unless user explicitly forces override)

C) Feedback / editing

* User can add/remove/edit keywords directly from the UI.
* User can optionally ask AI to “suggest replacements” for low-performing or irrelevant keywords.
* Any edits are persisted as the canonical target list and are used in the next SERP run.

D) UI simplification

* Remove the “Top Ranking Keywords” section entirely.
* Keep:

  * KPI cards (Top 1 / Top 3 / Top 10 / Total Ranking) using exclusive buckets + movement per card
  * One “All Keywords” table as the main view

Architecture: Keyword Source of Truth
Create a canonical “Target Keywords” list stored in DB:

* target_keywords table (or equivalent):

  * id
  * domain
  * keyword
  * priority (optional)
  * intent/category (optional)
  * created_at, updated_at
  * is_active (soft delete)
  * source (AI/manual/import)
  * notes/feedback (optional)

IMPORTANT: SERP checks should run ONLY against this target list (not against what happens to be returned from other sources).

How to Generate the 100 Target Keywords (choose one and implement cleanly)
Implement ONE primary method now, but structure it so swapping sources later is easy.

Option 1 (Recommended): Use ChatGPT directly (Replit integrated LLM)

* Add server endpoint: POST /api/keywords/generate
* Input: domain, business type/category, location (optional), services (optional)
* Output: array of ~100 keywords with optional metadata (priority, intent)
* Save them to target_keywords
* Return the saved list to the client

Option 2: Use an internal “Keyword Research” agent/worker (if it
