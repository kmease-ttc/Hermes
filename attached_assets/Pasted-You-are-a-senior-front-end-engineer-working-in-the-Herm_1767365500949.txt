You are a senior front-end engineer working in the Hermes SEO / Arclo UI codebase.

Task
On **Natasha’s page**, update the **Overview section** to clearly use **Market SOV** and **Tracked SOV** as the primary Share of Voice metrics, and move detailed Share of Voice analysis to the bottom of the page.

What to change

1. Overview section (top of Natasha page)

* In the KPI / Overview row:

  * Display **Market SOV**
    Label: `Market SOV`
    Definition: CTR-weighted visibility across *all target keywords* (from Lookout rankings).
  * Display **Tracked SOV**
    Label: `Tracked SOV`
    Definition: Visibility vs the curated competitor set (current competitive snapshot metric).
* Do **not** show any generic or ambiguous “Share of Voice” label in the Overview.
* Both KPIs must always show a numeric percent (0–100), never blank.

2. Bottom of page – Share of Voice section

* Keep a dedicated **Share of Voice** section lower on the page (below competitors / gap analysis).
* This section should:

  * Explain the difference between Market SOV and Tracked SOV.
  * Show any charts, breakdowns, or competitor comparisons you already have.
  * Use this section for interpretation and detail, not headline KPIs.

3. Data wiring rules

* Market SOV:

  * Source: Lookout keyword rankings.
  * Use CTR-weighted calculation already implemented.
* Tracked SOV:

  * Source: Competitive Snapshot API.
  * Uses the curated competitor list (the 5 competitors shown on Natasha’s page).
* Do not recompute these in multiple places—use the same normalized values for both Overview KPIs and the detailed section.

4. UX / copy requirements

* Overview KPIs should be concise and scannable.
* Bottom Share of Voice section can include helper text like:

  * “Market SOV shows how visible you are across all target keywords.”
  * “Tracked SOV compares your visibility against selected competitors.”
* Avoid confusing language like “User Voice” or unlabeled “Share of Voice.”

Acceptance criteria

* Natasha Overview shows **Market SOV** and **Tracked SOV** clearly.
* No duplicate or conflicting “Share of Voice” KPIs in the Overview.
* A single, clear Share of Voice section exists at the bottom for deeper analysis.
* Metrics update correctly after running analysis.
* No blanks, NaN, or zeroes unless the data truly warrants it.

Commit message
`refactor(natasha): use market and tracked SOV in overview and move detailed SOV analysis to bottom`
