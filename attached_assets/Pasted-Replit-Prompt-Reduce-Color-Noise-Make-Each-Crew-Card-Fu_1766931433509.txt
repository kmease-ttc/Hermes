Replit Prompt: Reduce Color Noise — Make Each Crew Card Fully “Crew-Themed” (single accent color per card)

Goal
Crew cards look better, but we’re using too many accent colors at once. I want each crew card to be primarily themed to that crew member’s color so the UI feels consistent and intentional.

Design Rule

* Each crew card gets ONE accent color (the crew’s theme color).
* That accent color is used consistently for:

  1. The score number in the top-right (e.g., “68/69”) → crew color
  2. The progress bar fill → crew color
  3. The “Watch” pill/button (and any primary CTA accent on the card) → crew color
  4. Optional: the card’s subtle top border / glow tint can stay crew-colored (light)

Allowed exceptions

* Negative deltas can remain red (e.g., “-12%” stays red).
* Neutral text stays neutral (white/gray), borders stay glassy.
* Status badges can remain semantic (success green, warning yellow, alert red) ONLY if needed. Otherwise prefer crew tint.

What to change (implementation)

1. Define a single crew color map (source of truth)

* Create/confirm a mapping like:

  * Lookout → pink
  * Natasha → red
  * Sentinel → blue
  * (others: assign their existing theme color)
* Store this in one place (e.g., shared/crewColors.ts or client/src/lib/crewColors.ts).

2. Pass “accentColor” through the Crew Card component

* In the crew card renderer (e.g., AgentCard / CrewSummaryCard / whatever renders this card):

  * compute accentColor from crew member
  * pass it to subcomponents that currently hardcode gold

3. Replace gold-only accents with accentColor
   Specifically for Lookout card:

* Score “68/69” should use pink text color
* Progress bar fill should use pink (not gold)
* “Watch” pill/button should use pink background/border/text (matching the current “Watch” style, just tinted pink)
* Any small decorative highlights should also match pink

4. Make it consistent across all crew cards

* For each crew member, the same 3 UI elements above should use that member’s color.
* Remove mixed accents (gold + pink + purple) inside a single card.

5. Keep red for negative delta

* “-12%” stays red.
* If there are positive deltas, they can stay green, unless we decide later to make them crew-colored too.

Acceptance criteria

* Each crew card visually reads as one cohesive theme color (Lookout = pink everywhere, Natasha = red everywhere, Sentinel = blue everywhere).
* No gold progress bars or gold “Watch” pills inside a non-gold crew card.
* The only “extra” color on the card should be semantic deltas (red for negative).
* Glass layout/typography remains
