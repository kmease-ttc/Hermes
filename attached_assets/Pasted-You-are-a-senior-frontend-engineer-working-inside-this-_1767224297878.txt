Goal
Standardize **Key Metrics highlight colors** so they match **Natasha’s purple accent**, not the green currently used on some other crew pages (e.g., Socrates, Hemingway, Speedster variants). Purple becomes the **default Key Metrics accent color** across all crews.

Scope

* This is a **visual-only change**.
* Do NOT change data, logic, or layout.
* Do NOT introduce per-crew color divergence.
* Natasha’s purple is the canonical color reference.

What to change

1. Identify the shared Key Metrics components

* Locate the shared components:

  * `KeyMetricsGrid`
  * `KeyMetricCard`
  * Any shared metric accent / glow / border styles
* Confirm where the accent color is currently defined (likely:

  * a CSS variable
  * a Tailwind class
  * or a status-to-color map)

2. Replace green accent with purple

* Wherever the Key Metrics cards use:

  * green border
  * green glow
  * green icon highlight
  * green top accent line
    Replace it with the **same purple used by Natasha’s cards**.

Important:

* Do NOT hardcode different purples per page.
* Extract or reuse a single token, for example:

  * `--metrics-accent-primary`
  * `metricsAccentColor`
  * `accentVariant="primary"`

3. Make purple the default Key Metrics accent

* The default (no status override) Key Metrics color = purple.
* Status-based coloring (green/yellow/red) can come later if needed, but for now:

  * All Key Metrics cards use purple accent consistently.
* Ensure:

  * Glass background stays the same
  * Shadows and blur stay the same
  * Only the accent color changes

4. Update all crew pages automatically
   Because all crews should already be using `KeyMetricsGrid`:

* This change should immediately affect:

  * Natasha (no visible change)
  * Socrates
  * Hemingway
  * Speedster
  * Any other crew with Key Metrics
    If any crew still looks green after this:
* That crew is not using the shared component and must be refactored to do so.

5. Visual verification checklist
   After the change:

* Natasha: unchanged (purple)
* Socrates: purple Key Metrics cards
* Hemingway: purple Key Metrics cards
* Speedster: purple Key Metrics cards (unless Speedster explicitly uses a different metric system like vitals — those can remain vitals-colored if separate)
* No green accent remains in Key Metrics sections

Non-goals

* Do NOT recolor mission widgets
* Do NOT recolor vitals-specific charts
* Do NOT change buttons, pills, or icons outside Key Metrics

Deliverables

* File paths updated
* Confirmation that all Key Metrics cards now use the same purple accent as Natasha
* Screenshot or description verifying at least two other crew pages now show purple Key Metrics
