CREW TILES – ULTRA COMPACT PASS (EVEN LESS SPACE) WITHOUT SHRINKING AVATAR

Context:
We like the bot size. Do NOT reduce avatar scale or the perceived size of the bots.
We need to compress the tile UI chrome even more:
- The info icon + Active badge must be tucked tighter into corners
- The name must sit MUCH closer to the bot (reduce gap another 50–70%)
- Remove any reserved vertical space for labels; use overlays instead

Non-negotiable:
1) Do NOT shrink the avatar image.
2) Reduce spacing by changing layout strategy: use overlay layers, not stacked layout.
3) Name, info icon, and badge must remain inside the tile frame.

### 1) TOP OVERLAY: TIGHT CORNERS
- Move info icon and Active badge to absolute overlays:
  - info icon: top-left, inset 6px
  - Active badge: top-right, inset 6px
- Reduce their footprint:
  - info icon container: 18px (icon 12px)
  - badge text: text-xs or text-sm, but compact padding (px-2 py-0.5)
- Ensure overlay does not push avatar down (no layout flow impact).

### 2) NAME AS BOTTOM OVERLAY BAR (KEY CHANGE)
Stop reserving vertical space for the name.

- Add a bottom overlay strip inside the tile:
  - position: absolute; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
  - height: ~46–54px
  - background: subtle gradient up (transparent -> dark) so text is readable
- Place the name inside that strip:
  - font size: increase (text-lg)
  - font weight: semibold
  - line-height: tight
- This allows the avatar to visually sit closer to the name without needing a big gap.

Important:
- The avatar can visually overlap behind the bottom strip slightly (that’s fine).
- The name must NEVER render outside the tile.

### 3) AVATAR POSITIONING (KEEP SIZE, MOVE DOWN)
- Keep avatar container size the same
- Move avatar DOWN slightly so feet approach the name overlay:
  - translateY(+8px to +16px) OR reduce top padding to near zero
- Remove any spacer/gap utilities that add vertical breathing room.

Goal:
- Feet-to-name spacing reduced by another 50–70% from current.

---

### 4) REDUCE TILE PADDING (FRAME TIGHTENING)
- Reduce internal padding to near zero:
  - top padding: 0 (overlays handle it)
  - side padding: 0–6px max
  - bottom padding: 0 (name overlay handles it)
