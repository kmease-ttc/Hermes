Below are **copy-ready implementation instructions** you can hand directly to your dev team. This is written as a **design + data sourcing spec**, not product copy.

# Replace Example Icons with Real Photos — Implementation Instructions

## Objective

Replace the current **icon-based example cards** (Plumbing, HVAC, Dental Clinic, Landscaping) with **real, high-quality photos** that make the examples feel tangible, trustworthy, and “real-world.”

The goal is to:

* Increase perceived credibility
* Make examples feel like *actual businesses*
* Reduce the “template / placeholder” feel
* Improve conversion by anchoring examples in reality

---

## High-Level Design Requirements

1. **Photos replace icons entirely**

   * No icons visible once photos are implemented
   * Cards should feel like “mini websites,” not feature tiles

2. **Photos must look real, not stocky**

   * Avoid overly staged, corporate stock photos
   * Prefer natural, in-context images (real storefronts, technicians, interiors, work in progress)

3. **Consistent visual treatment across all cards**

   * Same aspect ratio
   * Same corner radius
   * Same overlay/gradient treatment (if any)

---

## Photo Sourcing Strategy (Required)

### Option A — Preferred (Best Quality)

**Use Unsplash or Pexels via keyword + location targeting**

For each industry card, pull **1 primary photo** using a deterministic query so results are reproducible.

Recommended queries:

* **Plumbing**

  * `local plumber working`
  * `plumber residential repair`
  * `plumbing service technician`

* **HVAC**

  * `hvac technician residential`
  * `air conditioning repair technician`
  * `hvac service home`

* **Dental Clinic**

  * `modern dental clinic interior`
  * `dentist office patient`
  * `dental clinic exam room`

* **Landscaping**

  * `landscaping crew residential`
  * `landscaper working yard`
  * `landscape maintenance crew`

**Rules:**

* Prefer photos with people or real environments
* Avoid extreme close-ups of tools only
* Avoid logos, signage with visible brand names
* Avoid overly polished “marketing” shots

---

### Option B — Fallback (If API limits / reliability issues)

**Manually curate 3–5 approved images per industry and store locally**

* Save images under `/public/examples/{industry}/`
* Pick 1 default per card
* Optional: rotate images on refresh later

---

## Image Specs

* **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 (recommended)
* **Minimum resolution:** 1600×900
* **Crop style:** center-weighted (faces/work visible)
* **File format:** `.jpg` or optimized `.webp`

---

## Card Layout Changes

### Before

* Icon centered in colored container
* Flat color background

### After

* **Photo fills the top portion of the card**
* Text content remains unchanged below

### Required Card Structure

```

## Styling Requirements

1. **Photo container**

   * Rounded corners match existing card radius
   * `object-fit: cover`
   * Fixed height (e.g., 180–220px desktop, responsive on mobile)

2. **Optional overlay (recommended)**

   * Subtle bottom gradient (transparent → white)
   * Improves text contrast if overlaying title later

3. **Hover behavior**

   * Slight zoom (`scale(1.03)`) OR
   * Subtle shadow elevation
   * No animation overload

---

## Accessibility & SEO

* **Alt text required for every image**

  * Format:

    * `Plumbing service example website`
    * `HVAC company website example`
    * `Dental clinic website example`
    * `Landscaping business website example`

* Use `loading="lazy"` for all example images

---

## Data Model Update (If Needed)

If examples are data-driven:

```ts
{
  industry: "Plumbing",
  location: "Austin, TX",
  demoUrl: "...",
  imageUrl: "/examples/plumbing/plumber-working.jpg"
}
```

Do **not** embed image URLs inline in JSX. Use structured data so examples are easy to update later.

---

## Future-Proofing (Optional, Not Required Now)

* Allow multiple images per example and rotate
* Tie image selection to generated site theme
* Replace static photos later with screenshots of real generated sites

---

## Success Criteria

This change is complete when:

* Icons are fully removed
* Each example card visually reads as a *real business*
* Page feels more like a portfolio than a template gallery
* No visual regressions on mobile
* Load performance remains acceptable

---

## Summary (Internal)

> Replace symbolic icons with real-world photos to increase trust, realism, and conversion. These examples should feel like *actual businesses we’ve already helped*, not abstract demos.

If you want next steps after this:

* Add **before/after SEO metrics** on hover
* Add **“Generated in 60 seconds”** badge
* Add **industry-specific copy under each example**

Just say the word.
