Replit Prompt: Increase Crew Color Variation (Avoid “Three Blue Bots”) While Keeping Brightness Consistent

Problem
After applying the tinted glass effect, multiple crew members are now reading as the same color family (we effectively have three “blue” bots/cards). The UI needs more color variety so each crew member is instantly distinguishable, but we still need consistent brightness/contrast across all crew accents.

Goal
Adjust the crew accent palette so:

* No more than ONE crew member uses the same primary hue family (e.g., only one “blue”).
* Each crew member has a distinct accent color.
* All accents have matched perceived brightness on the dark glass UI.
* Red remains reserved for negative deltas/errors (not a crew identity color).
* Gold remains reserved for attention/queues (not a crew identity color).
* Crew accents still feel “space UI” (not rainbow/neon).

Scope

* Crew Summary cards (Mission Control)
* My Crew page cards/tiles (wherever crew colors are used)
* Pills/labels/progress bars/score numbers that use crew colors
* Central crew color map / tokens ONLY (no page-by-page hacks)

Implementation steps

1. Create a balanced crew palette (distinct hues)
   Update the centralized crew color map so each crew member is in a different hue family:

* Lookout → Pink/Magenta (keep)
* Speedster → Green (keep)
* Sentinel → Indigo/Violet (shift away from blue if currently blue)
* Popular → Cyan/Teal (keep, but ensure it’s clearly teal not blue)
* Scotty → Amber/Orange (high-contrast, distinct; NOT gold/yellow)
* Natasha → Purple/Violet OR Teal (non-red), whichever is not already taken
* Any other crew: assign remaining distinct hues (e.g., aqua, lime, orchid) but keep within tasteful sci-fi palette

Hard rules:

* Only one “true blue” max (if any).
* Avoid assigning “gold/yellow” to a crew member (reserved for attention UI).
* Avoid “red” for a crew member (reserved for errors/negative deltas).

2. Normalize brightness across the palette
   For each crew accent, define:

* accent (solid)
* accentSoft (tint background)
* accentBorder (border/glow)
  Tune values so all accents have similar perceived luminance on dark backgrounds.

3. Apply crew palette everywhere via tokens (no hardcoding)

* Ensure Crew cards and crew pills pull their tint from crew tokens only.
* Ensure tinted glass background uses accentSoft and border uses accentBorder.

4. Add a quick “visual check” in dev
   Create a small internal /palette or /crew-colors dev page that renders:

* each crew’s card
* each crew’s pills
* each crew’s tintedGlass background
  so we can sanity-check distinctness and brightness quickly.

Acceptance criteria

* On Mission Control Crew Summary, each card is immediately distinguishable by color at a glance.
* No three cards feel “blue-ish” in the same way.
* Natasha is not red.
* Scotty is no longer muted and is clearly distinct from Popular/Sentinel.
* Overall palette still feels cohesive and premium (space UI), not a chaotic rainbow.

Deliverable

* Updated centralized crew color tokens/map
* Crew cards + pills automatically reflect new palette everywhere
* Optional dev palette preview page for ongoing QA
