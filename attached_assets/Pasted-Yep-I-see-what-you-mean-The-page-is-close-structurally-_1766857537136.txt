Yep — I see what you mean. The page is *close* structurally, but it’s failing on hierarchy + density in a few spots. Here’s what I’d change, in the same spirit of the design you already have, and what I think you should delete/keep.

## 1) Rename + contrast

* Rename **“Captain’s Recommendations” → “Recommendations”**
* Increase contrast by turning that whole section into a **real container** (card inside a card, or a stronger header band).
* Each recommendation should be a **distinct mini-card** with a divider, not a flat list.

### Layout change

* Recommendations area becomes:

  * Header row (title + confidence + “X/10 agents”)
  * Then **3 recommendation cards** stacked with clear separators.

## 2) Agent Highlights: replace the strip with “Agent Summary Cards”

You’re right: the strip isn’t useful because it lacks meaning.

### Replace the strip entirely with a 2-row grid of “Agent Summary Cards”

Each card should show:

* Agent name + icon
* Score (large) + progress bar
* 1 key metric (big number)
* Verdict chip (Good/Watch/Bad)
* One-line “What changed”
* CTA: Review agent

This makes the highlights actually “highlight something.”

**Suggested layout**

* 2 rows x 3 cards (6 visible by default)
* “View all agents” link to the Agents page

Example card (Pulse):

* **7,242** sessions (7d)
* **-50% WoW**
* Verdict: **Bad**
* “Drop is likely indexing/ranking”
* Review Pulse

## 3) Agents section: don’t show a single number — show the full cards

You called this out and you’re correct.

### Fix

* The Agents section should render the **same full agent cards** you built on the Agents page (one per line), not a collapsed numeric-only view.
* On Mission Control, show the **top 4** agents by relevance (based on recommendations) + a “View all agents” button.

## 4) Conversion Rate card: keep it, but fix the bugs + add 2 more cards

That “conversion rate” tile is the best visual element on the page — it just needs spacing fixes and friends.

### Bugs

* The “Needs improvement” badge is overflowing its container → fix with:

  * consistent padding
  * `overflow-hidden` on card
  * prevent chips from wrapping outside (`max-w`, `truncate`, `flex-wrap` rules)

* The blue dots are misaligned → the sparkline should be centered and clipped inside the card.

### Add 2 more cards in that same style

Make a 3-card row:

1. Conversion Rate
2. Bounce Rate (or Engaged Sessions)
3. Calls / Leads (or Form Submits)

Each card has:

* Large number
* Delta
* Small sparkline
* Verdict chip
* One next step link (Review…)

## 5) Benchmarks + Knowledge Insights: side-by-side is fine, but make them feel “alive”

Right now they look like placeholders. Keep them side-by-side but give them visual structure.

### Industry Benchmarks

* Add a simple bar comparison:

  * You vs Industry average
  * Percentile badge (e.g., “62nd percentile”)
* If data missing, still show the bar skeleton and “Run diagnostics to populate.”

### Knowledge Base Insights

* Show 3 feed items by default:

  * Agent icon + title + timestamp
  * One-line insight
  * “Apply / Export Prompt” action

## 6) Diagnostic Tickets: I agree — likely remove from Mission Control

You already have **Action Queue**, and it’s better.

### Recommendation

* Remove Diagnostic Tickets from Mission Control entirely.
* Keep Tickets as a **secondary view** inside Agents or a “Diagnostics” page if you need it later.
* Mission Control should be opinionated: actions > tickets.

## 7) Action Queue: add “Review / Approve / Export Prompt” everywhere

You mentioned “review or approve” — do it consistently:

* Recommendations cards: **Review**
* Action Queue: **Review / Approve / Export Prompt**
* Knowledge insights items: **Export Prompt**

That’s the workflow loop you want.

# What I would change (summary)

* Rename “Captain’s…” → “Recommendations”
* Make Recommendations more contrasty and card-based
* Replace Agent strip with 6 meaningful agent summary cards
* Show full agent cards (top 4) rather than single numbers
* Fix conversion card overflow + add 2 more matching cards
* Keep Benchmarks + Knowledge Insights but make them visually populated
* Remove Diagnostic Tickets from Mission Control (action queue replaces it)

---

If you want, I can generate a **new rendering** of Mission Control that reflects *exactly* the above changes (same general visual style as your page, but corrected hierarchy and more visual density where it matters).
