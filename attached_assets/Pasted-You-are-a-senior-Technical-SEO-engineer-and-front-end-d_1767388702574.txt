You are a senior Technical SEO engineer and front-end developer working in the Hermes SEO / Arclo codebase.

Goal
Fully populate **Scotty’s page** so it reflects the critical importance of Technical SEO. Scotty should surface crawlability, rendering, indexing, and performance issues clearly and actionably.

Scotty’s mission
“Ensure the site is crawlable, indexable, fast, and technically sound so other agents (Lookout, Natasha, Content agents) can succeed.”

Do NOT treat Scotty as secondary. This page should feel foundational.

---

## Part A — KPI / Metrics section (top of page)

Use the **standard KPI style guide** (same component as Natasha/Lookout).

Scotty KPIs should be:

1. **Crawl Health**

* Definition: % of crawled URLs returning valid 200 responses and renderable HTML.
* Source: crawl-render service results.
* Value: percent (0–100)
* Status colors:

  * Green ≥ 90%
  * Gold 70–89%
  * Red < 70%

2. **Index Coverage**

* Definition: Indexed URLs ÷ eligible URLs.
* Source: GSC Indexing data (or crawler indexability flags if GSC unavailable).
* Value: percent
* Status rules same as above.

3. **Core Web Vitals**

* Definition: % of URLs passing CWV thresholds.
* Source: CWV worker.
* Value: percent
* Status:

  * Green ≥ 75%
  * Gold 50–74%
  * Red < 50%

4. **Critical Technical Issues**

* Definition: Count of blocking issues.
* Includes:

  * noindex on important pages
  * blocked by robots.txt
  * 5xx errors
  * render-blocked JS
* Value: integer
* Status:

  * Green = 0
  * Gold = 1–3
  * Red > 3

Remove any placeholder KPIs. No blanks allowed.

---

## Part B — Missions section (Scotty-specific)

Scotty missions should be **keyword-agnostic** and **blocking-oriented**.

Include these missions:

1. **Run Site Crawl**

* Action: triggers crawl-render worker.
* Output:

  * URL list
  * status codes
  * render success
  * JS errors

2. **Check Indexing Status**

* Action: validate indexability flags + GSC index state.
* Output:

  * Indexed
  * Excluded (with reason)
  * Blocked

3. **Audit Core Web Vitals**

* Action: CWV worker run.
* Output:

  * LCP / CLS / INP status
  * failing URLs

4. **Technical Fix Queue**

* Auto-generated from findings.
* Each item must be “Fixable” (deployable) or “Advisory”.

---

## Part C — Findings tab (default active tab)

This is Scotty’s most important section.

Render a table grouped by **severity**:

### Critical (blocking SEO)

* 5xx pages
* noindex on indexable pages
* blocked by robots.txt
* canonical to non-indexable URL
* JS render failures

### Warnings

* redirect chains
* duplicate canonicals
* soft 404s
* missing hreflang (if applicable)

### Informational

* unused JS/CSS
* large DOM size
* slow TTFB

Each finding must include:

* URL
* Issue type
* Severity
* “Fix” button if deployable
* “Why this matters” tooltip (short)

---

## Part D — Controls / Fixes

For deployable issues:

* Show a **Fix** button that queues SEO_DEPLOYER actions:

  * update robots
  * remove noindex
  * fix canonicals
  * optimize headers
* Show progress + completion status.

If not deployable:

* Label clearly as “Advisory”.

---

## Part E — Trends (lightweight, not keyword-based)

Scotty trends should track:

* Crawl health % over time
* Indexed URL count over time
* CWV pass rate over time
* Critical issues count over time

Use the same snapshot infrastructure as Natasha Trends, but with **technical metrics only**.

---

## Part F — Validation rules

* Scotty’s KPIs must never be blank.
* If data is unavailable:

  * Show 0 or “No data yet”
  * Include CTA: “Run crawl to populate”
* Scotty’s numbers should not contradict Lookout/Natasha.

  * Scotty answers “can Google crawl/index us?”
  * Lookout answers “where do we rank?”

---

## Acceptance criteria

* Scotty page feels dense, serious, and operational.
* KPIs immediately communicate site health.
* Findings table is populated after one crawl.
* Fix buttons work for deployable issues.
* No placeholder widgets remain.
