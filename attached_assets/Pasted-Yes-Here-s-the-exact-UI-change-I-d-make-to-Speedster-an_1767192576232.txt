Yes. Here’s the exact UI change I’d make to Speedster (and then we can propagate it as the standard):

## 1) Merge “Mission Status” + “Missions” into one widget

### New widget name

**Mission Overview** (or keep **Mission Status** as the header if you want to preserve the label)

### Layout (single card)

Top row:

* **Performance Score** badge stays exactly as-is (the “65” circle).
* Title: **Mission Overview**
* Status pill: **Needs attention** (same logic you have today)
* Right-side primary CTA: keep your existing button (e.g. **Fix Everything** / **Generate Plan** depending on state)

Body:

* One-line summary (from Mission Status):

  * Example: “1 vital in poor range.”
* “Next:” line (from Mission Status):

  * Example: “Focus on fixing poor metrics first”

Then immediately below, inside the same card:

* Section title: **Next Actions**
* Show the same mission list you currently render in “Missions”, but **limit to top 2–3 items** with:

  * Mission title
  * One-line description
  * Impact/effort indicator (if present)
  * Right-side action button (e.g. **Fix it**, **Generate Plan**)

At the bottom of the card:

* Link-style button: **View all missions** (takes you to the full missions section or expands inline)

Result: one widget that reads like:
Score + status + what to do next (in one glance).

---

## 2) Add “Recently Completed” to that same widget

Add a third section at the bottom of the merged card:

### Section: Recently Completed

* Show **only the most recent completed action** (one item max)
* Display:

  * Action title (e.g. “Optimized hero image format”)
  * Timestamp relative (e.g. “3m ago”)
  * Optional: a small “Completed” badge/check

If there is none:

* “No completed actions yet.”

This should pull from the same execution/audit log that “Fix Everything” uses (or whatever you’re using to track queued/completed actions).

---

## 3) Behavior rules

* When an action completes, “Recently Completed” updates immediately.
* When there are no missions, the “Next Actions” section collapses and you show:

  * “No open missions. Nice work.”
* Keep the card height stable as much as possible (don’t jump wildly).

---

## 4) Acceptance criteria

* Mission Status card disappears.
* Missions card disappears (or becomes “View all missions” target).
* Single merged card shows:

  * Score
  * Status
  * Next
  * Next Actions (top missions)
  * Recently Completed (last one only)

---

If you want the fastest implementation, do it only on Speedster first (since it’s the canonical layout), then we reuse the same component across every crew page.
