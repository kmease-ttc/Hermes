Natasha Crew Dashboard — Competitive Intelligence (Spec)

Purpose
Natasha’s dashboard is the **strategic awareness layer** of the platform. While other crews execute diagnostics or fixes, Natasha answers one question clearly:

“How do I stack up against my competitors, and what should I do next to win?”

This dashboard should make competitive SEO understandable at a glance, while allowing deep drill-down when needed. It follows the same **discoverable complexity** principle as Mission Control: simple summary first, deeper insight on demand.

---

1. Dashboard Structure (Top → Bottom)

A. Competitive Status (Summary Strip)
A compact, high-level summary similar in spirit to Mission Status, but scoped to competition.

Contents:

* Overall Competitive Position:

  * “Ahead of competitors”
  * “At parity”
  * “Behind competitors”
* 1-line explanation:

  * Example: “You trail top competitors in 12 high-value keywords and 3 content clusters.”
* Primary action button:

  * “Improve Competitive Position”

    * This routes into recommended missions (content gaps, link gaps, SERP features, etc.)

Data sources:

* Aggregated keyword rank deltas
* Visibility / share of voice comparison
* Number of gap items detected

---

2. Competitor Landscape

A. Identified Competitors
Explicitly show *who* Natasha considers competitors.

Table or card list:

* Competitor domain
* Type (Direct / Indirect / SERP-only)
* Market overlap score (0–100)
* Last updated timestamp

Behaviors:

* Ability to remove or mark a competitor as “ignore”
* Ability to add a competitor manually (even if not auto-detected)

Notes:

* Competitors should be discoverable via:

  * Shared keyword rankings
  * SERP co-occurrence
  * Backlink overlap
* Even if worker doesn’t support this yet, the UI should assume it will.

3. Ranking & Visibility Comparison

A. Keyword Position Comparison
This is the core of competitive intel.

Views:

* Summary metrics:

  * Total tracked keywords
  * Keywords where competitor outranks you
  * Keywords where you outrank competitor
* Comparison table:

  * Keyword
  * Your rank
  * Best competitor rank
  * Rank delta
  * Estimated traffic impact

Sorting:

* Largest negative delta first
* Highest traffic opportunity first

Filtering:

* Brand vs non-brand
* Intent (informational, commercial, transactional)
* Position bands (1–3, 4–10, 11–20, etc.)

---

B. Share of Voice / SERP Presence
A higher-level abstraction for non-SEO experts.

Metrics:

* Share of Voice (%)
* SERP visibility index
* Average rank across tracked keywords

Visualization:

* Simple horizontal comparison bars (you vs top 3 competitors)
* Avoid charts that feel like analytics tools; keep it executive-friendly

---

4. Competitive Gap Analysis (The “Why”)

A. Content Gaps
Where competitors rank and you don’t.

For each gap:

* Topic / keyword cluster
* Competitors ranking
* Your current coverage (none / thin / outdated)
* Estimated opportunity (low / medium / high)

Actions:

* “Create content”
* “Expand existing content”
* “Optimize page”

---

B. Authority / Backlink Gaps
Where competitors have authority advantages.

Metrics:

* Referring domains (you vs competitor)
* High-authority links competitors have that you don’t
* Link velocity comparison

Actions:

* “Pursue similar links”
* “Strengthen internal linking”
* “Promote content”

---

C. SERP Feature Gaps
Where competitors win enhanced SERP placements.

Features:

* Featured snippets
* People Also Ask
* Image packs
* Local packs (if applicable)

For each:

* Competitor owning the feature
* Page type they’re using
* Structural hints (FAQ, schema, headings)

Actions:

* “Optimize for snippet”
* “Add schema”
* “Restructure content”

---

5. Competitive Delta Score (Optional but Powerful)

A single synthesized score per competitor:

* Ranking Delta
* Content Coverage Delta
* Authority Delta
* SERP Feature Delta

Output:

* “You are 18 points behind competitor X”
* Clear explanation of what drives the delta

This enables:

* Simple “win vs competitor” tracking over time
* Executive-friendly reporting

---

6. Recommended Competitive Missions

This is where Natasha hands off to execution.

A. Prioritized Recommendations
Ordered list of actions derived from gaps:

* “Close content gap on [topic]”
* “Target featured snippet for [keyword]”
* “Strengthen authority in [cluster]”

Each item includes:

* Expected impact
* Difficulty
* Which crew executes it (Speedster, Scotty, Atlas, etc.)

CTA:

* “Create Mission”
* “Fix Automatically” (if supported)

---

7. Competitive Trends & Change Detection

A. Movement Over Time
Show how competition is evolving.

Metrics:

* Rank gains/losses over last 7 / 30 / 90 days
* New competitors entering SERPs
* Competitors accelerating content or links

Alerts:

* “Competitor X jumped ahead in 5 high-value keywords”
* “New competitor detected in your core SERP”

---

8. UX & Styling Guidelines

* Reuse existing dark + glass theme
* No heavy charts; prefer clean tables, bars, and concise summaries
* Emphasize deltas, not raw data
* Make it obvious what’s actionable vs informational
* Avoid SEO jargon where possible; use tooltips for advanced terms

---

9. Acceptance Criteria

* A user can answer in under 10 seconds:

  * Who am I competing against?
  * Am I winning or losing?
  * What should I do next?
* The dashboard supports both:

  * High-level executives
  * Deep SEO practitioners
* All insights can map cleanly to missions, even if workers are extended later

---

Outcome
Natasha’s dashboard becomes the **strategic brain** of the system: it doesn’t just report rankings, it explains the competitive landscape, highlights gaps, and directly connects insight to action.
