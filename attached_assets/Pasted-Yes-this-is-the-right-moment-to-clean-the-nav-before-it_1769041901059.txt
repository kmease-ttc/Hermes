Yes — this is the **right moment** to clean the nav before it calcifies. What you’re describing is a **clear, scalable IA** that matches how people actually think about the product.

I’ll do this in two parts:

1. Design / UX rationale (so you’re confident)
2. **Exact instructions** you can paste to the Replit agent

---

## 1. UX Design Review: Left Nav (What it should become)

### Core principle

The left nav should answer **one question per item**:

* *Where am I right now?*
* *What can I buy?*
* *What can I inspect?*
* *What is configuration?*

Right now, too many things are “first class” that shouldn’t be.

---

## 2. Recommended Left Nav Structure (Clean + Logical)

### ✅ Keep top-level nav SHORT (5–6 items max)

**Final proposed nav:**

1. **Dashboard**
2. **Agents**
3. **Achievements**
4. **Reports** *(optional later)*
5. **Settings**

That’s it.

Everything else collapses underneath **Settings** or disappears.

---

## 3. What moves where (explicit mapping)

### Collapse into **Settings**

These are operational, not product value:

* Tickets
* Changes
* Runs
* Integrations
* API / Keys
* Domains
* Notifications

**Why:**
These are *necessary*, but not *core*. Power users will find them. New users won’t be distracted.

---

### Agents (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

Agents becomes a **commercial + insight surface**, not a system view.

**Agents page should:**

* Show **cards per agent/module**
* Each card answers:

  * What this agent does
  * What it did recently
  * Why it matters
* Clear purchase / upgrade state

**Remove entirely from Agents page:**

* Missions
* Task queues
* Internal execution concepts

Those are implementation details.

---

### Agent drill-down pages (keep)

This is where your architecture really shines.

Each agent/module gets:

* Its own dashboard page
* Focused metrics
* Key insights
* Recent actions
* History

The **drill-down model is correct** — keep it.

---

### Achievements (keep, but collapsed)

You’re right here too.

* Achievements are motivating
* They are *not* something users need every day

**Implementation:**

* Keep Achievements as a nav item
* Collapsed / secondary visual weight
* Almost “game-like” discovery

This adds character without clutter.

---

## 4. Remove Missions (for now)

This is the right call.

**Why:**

* Missions are internal orchestration
* They confuse “automation” with “work”
* They pull users into thinking they need to manage the system

Autonomous products should not expose their job queue.

If missions come back later, they come back as:

> “What Arclo is working on right now”

Not as a control surface.

---

## 5. Instructions to send to the Replit agent (copy-paste)

Goal: Simplify the left navigation to reflect product value, reduce cognitive load, and support a clean commercial model.

Left Nav Structure
Top-level items should be:

* Dashboard
* Agents
* Achievements
* Settings

Navigation Changes

1. Collapse the following into Settings:

   * Tickets
   * Changes
   * Runs
   * Integrations
   * API / Keys
   * Domains
   * Notifications

2. Agents page redesign:

   * Agents page becomes a card-based catalog.
   * One card per agent/module.
   * Each card shows:

     * What the agent does (1 sentence)
     * Key recent insight or action
     * Current status (active / available / upgrade)
   * Remove the Missions section entirely from the Agents page.

3. Agent drill-down pages:

   * Keep individual dashboard pages per agent.
   * Agents page links to each drill-down.
   * Drill-down pages show metrics, insights, and recent activity only.

4. Achievements:

   * Keep as a top-level nav item.
   * Visually de-emphasize (collapsed by default).
   * Treat as motivational / secondary content.

Design Rules

* Left nav should never expose internal orchestration concepts.
* Navigation labels should reflect user value, not system mechanics.
* Fewer top-level items = higher perceived polish.

Acceptance Criteria

* A new user understands where to click in under 5 seconds.
* No feeling of “admin dashboard” complexity.
* Agents feel like products, not background workers.

---

## Why this sets you up for “the hard stuff”

Once this nav is clean:

* Pricing becomes obvious
* Permissions become obvious
* Enterprise vs SMB split becomes easier
* The product feels *intentional*, not emergent

When you’re ready, the next hard step is:
**deciding what an Agent card shows vs what lives only in the drill-down**.

Say the word and we’ll lock that next.
