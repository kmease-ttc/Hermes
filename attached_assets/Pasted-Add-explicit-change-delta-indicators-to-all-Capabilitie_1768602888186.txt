Add explicit **change (delta) indicators** to all Capabilities & Performance KPIs so users can immediately see whether a metric went up or down and by how much.

## Goal

For every KPI card, show:

* Current value
* Direction of change (up / down / flat)
* Amount of change since the last run
  This must work for **both Sample and Live data**.

A user should be able to answer:
“Did this go up or down, and by how much?” at a glance.

---

## Data Model Change (Required)

Extend the Crew KPI snapshot with a previous value:

```
CrewKpiSnapshot {
  crewId
  primaryMetric: {
    key
    value
    previousValue
    unit
    isSample
    lastUpdatedAt
  }
}
```

If `previousValue` is missing:

* Show “—” for delta
* Do NOT guess

---

## Delta Calculation Logic

For numeric metrics:

```
delta = value - previousValue
```

* Positive → increase
* Negative → decrease
* Zero → no change

For percentage metrics:

* Show delta in percentage points (pp), not percent of percent

Example:

* 34 → 35 = **+1**
* 72% → 68% = **−4pp**

---

## UI Rules (Very Important)

Add a **small delta indicator near the metric value**, not hidden in a tooltip.

Examples:

* `35  ▲ +1`
* `68% ▼ −4`
* `91% —`

Color:

* Green = increase
* Red = decrease
* Gray = no change / no prior data

Direction arrow is mandatory.

---

## Sample vs Live Behavior

* Sample data **still shows deltas** if previous sample exists
* Sample badge stays, delta still renders
* Live badge + delta = ideal state

Do NOT suppress deltas just because data is sample.

---

## Edge Cases

* First run → show value only, delta = “—”
* Source reset → delta = “— (reset)”
* Previous value exists but stale → delta still shown, freshness badge handles trust

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* Beacon (Domain Authority) clearly shows:

  * Current DA
  * ▲ or ▼
  * Exact change amount
* User can tell in <1 second whether DA went up or down
* Works consistently across all crew cards
* No hover required to see the change

Do not redesign the layout.
Do not add charts.
Just add delta math + indicator.
