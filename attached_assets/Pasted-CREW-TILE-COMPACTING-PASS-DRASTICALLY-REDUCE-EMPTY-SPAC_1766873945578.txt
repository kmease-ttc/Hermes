CREW TILE COMPACTING PASS (DRASTICALLY REDUCE EMPTY SPACE) — DO NOT SHRINK AVATAR FILES

Goal:
Dramatically tighten the internal layout of every crew tile so:
- The space between the bot’s feet and the name is reduced by ~80%
- The Active badge and Info (eye / i) icon are larger and visually balanced with the name
- The tile frame shrinks around the content (less dead space), which will reduce overlap on the ship without changing avatar scale

Non-negotiable:
1) Do NOT change the bot image files.
2) Do NOT reduce the bot’s perceived size — keep bots large.
3) Reduce dead space by changing internal padding and layout, and by shrinking the tile container height/width slightly if needed.
4) The name, Active badge, and info icon must all remain inside the frame.

### A) INTERNAL TILE LAYOUT (MUST IMPLEMENT EXACTLY)
Switch each tile to an “overlay chrome + tight content” layout:

- Top overlay row (absolute inside tile):
  - Top-left: Info icon
  - Top-right: Active badge
  - Padding inset: 10px from edges
  - These overlays should NOT push content down (they float over the tile)

- Main content:
  - Avatar container sits high and large
  - Name sits directly under avatar with minimal gap

Rules:
- Remove any vertical spacer divs.
- Do NOT use justify-between for full-height columns (it creates big gaps).
- Use a tight flex column with explicit small gaps.

---

### B) REDUCE SPACE BETWEEN AVATAR AND NAME (80% CUT)
Target:
- Gap between avatar bottom and name top should be ~6–10px (max).
Implementation:
- Set avatar container margin-bottom to 6px (or use gap-2).
- Reduce bottom padding on tile to 10–12px total.
- Set name line-height tight (1.1–1.2).

---

### C) MAKE NAME BIGGER + CONSISTENT
- Increase name font size by ~20–30% (e.g., text-lg)
- Semibold
- Single line + truncate if needed
- Keep name centered

---

### D) MAKE ACTIVE BADGE + INFO ICON BIGGER
They currently look too small compared to the name.

- Info icon:
  - Increase to 18–20px button size
  - Icon itself 12–14px
  - Hit target stays clickable
- Active badge:
  - Increase font to match name scale (e.g., text-sm)
  - Reduce padding but keep readable (px-3 py-1)
  - Keep in top-right corner

These should feel balanced with the larger name.

---

### E) SHRINK TILE FRAME AROUND CONTENT (WITHOUT SHRINKING BOT)
We want less empty border around everything, which will reduce overlap on the ship.

- Reduce internal padding in the tile from current to:
  - top padding: minimal (overlays handle top)
  - side padding: ~12px
  - bottom padding: ~10–12px

Optional (if still too roomy):
- Reduce overall tile size slightly (max 10–12% smaller)
BUT keep avatar container size the same so the bot still looks big.
(Effectively: less frame, same bot.)

---

### F) EMPTY SLOTS
Apply the same compacting approach:
- Role icon sits higher
- Role name closer
- Reduce “empty slot” text padding

---

### G) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Done when:
- The gap between avatar feet and the name is reduced by ~80%
- Active badge and info icon are noticeably larger and proportionate to name
- Tiles look tighter (less empty background inside the frame)
- Reduced tile footprint results in fewer overlaps with the ship background/bays
- No text or badge spills outside the frame
