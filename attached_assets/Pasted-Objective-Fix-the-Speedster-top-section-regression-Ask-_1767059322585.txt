Objective
Fix the Speedster top section regression: **Ask Speedster is still showing as a separate widget** and the top area feels split into multiple blocks. We need the **first two widgets merged into one cohesive “Speedster Top Widget”** so everything in the top area reads as a single unified component.

What’s wrong right now

* The top Speedster section is still rendering as two separate stacked widgets:

  1. Speedster header/info widget (Speedster + monitors/tags + actions)
  2. Ask Speedster widget (separate card)
* This creates extra vertical space and breaks the “single top module” design.

Required End State (Single Top Widget)
The top of the Speedster dashboard must be ONE unified container that includes:

* Speedster identity (icon, name, role/tag)
* Description line
* Monitor pills/tabs (LCP Tracking, CLS Tracking, INP Tracking, etc.)
* Right-side header actions:

  * Run Vitals Scan (use the existing refresh icon; do not duplicate)
  * Export Fix Pack (export icon)
  * Settings (if applicable)
* Ask Speedster input row, embedded inside the same container at the bottom:

  * Left: “Ask Speedster”
  * Right: inline input + send icon

There must NOT be any separate Ask Speedster card/widget anywhere on the page.

Implementation Instructions (Do this exactly)

1. Identify where Ask Speedster is currently rendered

* Search for the component usage on the Speedster page:

  * `<AskSpeedster />`, `<AskCrew />`, `<CrewPrompt />`, or similar
* It is currently being rendered as its own section below the header widget.

2. Remove the standalone Ask Speedster section

* Delete that rendering block from the page layout.
* Do not leave spacing or wrapper containers behind.

3. Render Ask Speedster inside the Speedster header container

* Update the Speedster header/top widget component so it accepts a “bottom slot” (or children) and render Ask Speedster there.
  Recommended:
* Modify `CrewDashboardHeader` (or SpeedsterHeader component) to support:

  * `footer` or `bottomContent` prop
* In Speedster page:

  * Pass the Ask Speedster row into that prop so it renders inside the same card/container.

4. Ask Speedster row layout (inline, condensed)
   Inside the top widget, at the bottom:

* Single row, no nested card
* Left side: small label “Ask Speedster”
* Right side: input stretches horizontally + send icon
* Use subtle divider or padding only if needed (no extra background panels)

5. Ensure spacing is compact

* Reduce bottom padding of the header widget and the top margin before Mission Status.
* After the unified top widget, the next section should be Mission Status with consistent spacing.

6. Verify actions aren’t duplicated

* The “Run Vitals Scan” action must only exist in the top widget actions area.
* Remove any other Run Scan button elsewhere.
* Export Fix Pack must only exist as a small icon button in the header actions.

Acceptance Criteria

* Visually, the Speedster page begins with one unified top container (no stacked header + prompt cards).
* Ask Speedster appears integrated at the bottom of that same container.
* No extra whitespace between the top area and Mission Status.
* Run Vitals Scan and Export Fix Pack are present only once, in the top widget actions area.
* No separate Ask Speedster widget exists anywhere on the page.
