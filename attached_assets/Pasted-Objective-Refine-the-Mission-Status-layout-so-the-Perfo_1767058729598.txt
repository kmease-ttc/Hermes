Objective
Refine the **Mission Status** layout so the **Performance score (65)** feels like a strong, intentional, anchored element on the left—visually comparable in quality to the Core Web Vitals cards—while preserving the gold styling and improving balance across the card.

This is a **visual/structural refinement**, not a logic change.

---

Design Intent (High Level)

* The left Performance score should feel like its **own mini-widget**, not just text dropped into a row.
* It should feel *anchored* to the left edge of the Mission Status card.
* The rest of the Mission Status content should clearly flow from that anchor.
* Keep the gold styling — that’s working well and should remain the visual focal point.

---

Required Layout Change

### 1. Create a Dedicated “Performance Score Block” (Left Column)

Replace the current small badge-style score with a **fixed-width vertical block** on the left side of Mission Status.

Requirements:

* Fixed width (e.g. ~96–120px)
* Full height of the Mission Status card
* Slightly darker or subtly distinct background (still within the Speedster green/gold palette)
* Rounded on the left side only (to feel docked into the card)
* Centered vertically and horizontally inside its block

Contents of the block:

* Large number: `65`
* Label below: `Performance`
* Keep the gold color for the number and/or accent ring
* Optional: subtle ring or bar, but do NOT over-design

This block should feel similar in weight and polish to the Core Web Vitals cards.

---

### 2. Main Mission Status Content (Center)

The center content should now clearly feel like it belongs to the right of the Performance block.

Structure:

* Row 1:

  * “Mission Status” label
  * Status chip (“Needs attention”) inline
* Row 2:

  * Short summary: “1 vital in poor range”
* Row 3:

  * Guidance line:

    * “Next: Focus on fixing poor metrics first”

Spacing:

* Add horizontal padding between the performance block and the text content.
* Ensure the text block is vertically centered relative to the full card height.

---

### 3. Action Button (Right)

* “Fix Everything” remains on the far right.
* Vertically centered relative to the entire Mission Status card.
* Do not let it visually compete with the performance block.
* Maintain current button styling.

---

### 4. Layout Implementation Guidance (Important)

Use a **3-part layout**:

* Outer container: flex row
* Left: `PerformanceScoreBlock` (fixed width, full height)
* Middle: `MissionStatusContent` (flex-grow)
* Right: `MissionActions` (auto width)

Key rules:

* `align-items: stretch` at the top level so the left block fills height
* Inner blocks handle their own centering
* No stacking on mobile yet — keep desktop polish first

---

### 5. What NOT to Change

* Do not remove or recolor the gold performance styling
* Do not add new copy
* Do not change mission logic or status computation
* Do not introduce new UI patterns not already used elsewhere

---

### Acceptance Criteria

* The Performance score feels like a **deliberate, anchored element**, not an add-on
* The Mission Status card feels balanced left-to-right
* Visual weight matches the quality of the Core Web Vitals cards
* The gold performance styling remains a highlight
* Overall polish feels “final”, not transitional

This prompt should result in a Mission Status card that visually belongs in the same design system as the rest of the Speedster dashboard.
