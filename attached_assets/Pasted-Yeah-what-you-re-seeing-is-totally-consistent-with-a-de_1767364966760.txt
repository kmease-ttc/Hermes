Yeah — what you’re seeing is totally consistent with a **definition mismatch**:

* **Natasha “Share of Voice”** is almost certainly being calculated from a **small, fixed competitor set** (the 5 competitors listed on the page).
* **Lookout** is showing **your keyword rankings in Google**, where the “competitors” at the top are often **national aggregators** (Psychology Today, Zocdoc, Healthgrades, etc.) plus whatever local clinic is strong for that term.
* If Natasha’s competitor set doesn’t include those big brands (or if the competitive worker only counts “wins/losses vs tracked competitors”), your SOV can easily be **0%** even while you’re ranking for a bunch of keywords.

So the fix isn’t “make the number not zero.” The fix is: **make SOV useful by defining it correctly for your use-case.**

## Make Share of Voice useful (what to change)

### 1) Split SOV into two metrics (recommended)

On Natasha, show both:

1. **Market SOV (Real SOV)**
   “How visible are we for our target keywords overall?”
   This is computed purely from **our ranks**, no competitor list required.

2. **Tracked Competitor SOV**
   “How visible are we versus the 5 tracked competitors?”
   This uses the competitor set and will be useful for “head-to-head” movement.

That solves the confusion immediately.

### 2) Make “Market SOV” use Lookout’s keyword data

Use the same keyword dataset Lookout already has:

* For each target keyword, take our current rank.
* Convert rank → visibility weight (simple CTR curve is fine).
* Average across all target keywords and show as a percent.

Example weights (good enough and stable):

* Rank 1: 1.00
* 2–3: 0.70
* 4–10: 0.40
* 11–20: 0.15
* 21–50: 0.05
* Not ranking: 0

`MarketSOV = round( sum(weights) / totalKeywords * 100 )`

Now Natasha’s SOV will align with Lookout.

### 3) Keep the competitor list, but make it dynamic (optional upgrade)

Right now your 5 competitors look “good” but they aren’t the ones dominating SERPs for many terms.

Make Natasha’s “Competitors” section support a toggle:

* **Tracked competitors** (your curated list)
* **SERP competitors** (auto-discovered from Lookout’s keyword results)

How to auto-discover SERP competitors:

* For each keyword, get the top 10 domains
* Count frequency across keywords
* Show top 10 domains (excluding your own)
* Label “National” vs “Local” (simple heuristic: known aggregators list + domain patterns)

This will surface PsychologyToday/Healthgrades/Zocdoc/etc. automatically so the page reflects reality.

## What you should do right now

If you want one clean change that makes everything click:

* Rename Natasha’s current “Share of Voice” to **“Tracked SOV”**
* Add a new KPI right next to it called **“Market SOV”** computed from Lookout rankings

That makes the metric meaningful even when the tracked competitor set is small or “wrong.”

If you want, I can write the exact Replit prompt to implement:

* Market SOV KPI + CTR weighting
* “Top SERP competitors” list from Lookout keywords
* A toggle between curated competitors and SERP-derived competitors
