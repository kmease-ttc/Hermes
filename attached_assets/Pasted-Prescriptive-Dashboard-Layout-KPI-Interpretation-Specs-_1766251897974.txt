Prescriptive Dashboard Layout & KPI Interpretation Specs

Objective  
Redesign the dashboard layout so that for every major KPI or section, the user can immediately answer four questions without clicking away:
1) Is this good or bad?
2) How bad (or how good) is it?
3) Why is this happening?
4) What do I need to do next?

The dashboard should behave like an **SEO decision system**, not a reporting surface.

---

## Core Design Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**Every KPI must include:**
- Direction (↑ ↓ →)
- Severity (Good / Warning / Critical)
- Primary cause (1–2 sentences)
- Next action (explicit recommendation)

If any KPI does not clearly answer “do I need to act?”, it is incomplete.

---

## Global Layout Rules

1) Replace “raw numbers first” with **interpretation first**
- Numbers are secondary.
- Status + explanation always comes before tables and charts.

2) No KPI should require a click to understand urgency
- Clicking should give depth, not clarity.

3) Every section must end with:
**“Recommended Next Action”**

---

## Section Structure Template (Use Everywhere)

Each section (Traffic, Technical SEO, Keyword Ranking, Competitors later) must follow this exact structure:

A) Status Header (above the fold)
B) KPI Snapshot (minimal)
C) Explanation (“Why this looks the way it does”)
D) Recommended Actions (1–3 max)

---

## 1) Website Traffic Section – Revised Spec

### 1.1 Status Header (Required)
Top of section should show a bold status bar:

- Status badge: Good / Needs Attention / Critical
- Direction indicator: ↑ ↓ →
- Delta context: “vs last 7 days / 30 days”

Example:
Website Traffic — Needs Attention ↓  
Organic sessions down 18% week-over-week

### 1.2 KPI Snapshot (Minimal, Interpretable)
Do NOT just show raw numbers.

Each KPI must include:
- Value
- Delta
- Interpretation tag

Example KPIs:
- Organic Sessions: 1,240 ↓ 18% (Below baseline)
- Total Sessions: 1,980 ↓ 9% (Mild decline)
- Branded Traffic: Stable (No issue)
- Non-Branded Traffic: ↓ 22% (Primary concern)

### 1.3 “Why” Explanation (Required)
Auto-generate a short explanation based on detected signals.

Example:
“Traffic decline is primarily driven by non-branded pages losing visibility. Branded traffic is stable, indicating demand has not dropped, but discovery has.”

Rules:
- 1–3 sentences max
- Reference concrete drivers (pages, keywords, channels)
- Never say “unknown” without saying what data is missing

### 1.4 Recommended Next Action (Required)
Explicit, ranked actions.

Example:
Recommended Actions:
1) Investigate ranking drops for top 5 non-branded landing pages
2) Review keyword positions 4–12 for quick recovery
3) Check for recent technical changes affecting indexation

Each action should be clickable and deep-link into the relevant detail view.

---

## 2) Keyword Ranking Section – Revised Spec

### 2.1 Status Header
Example:
Keyword Rankings — Needs Attention →  
Rankings are flat overall, but opportunity keywords are not improving

### 2.2 KPI Snapshot (Interpretation First)
Instead of just “Top 25 Keywords”:

Show:
- Keywords improving: X
- Keywords declining: Y
- Keywords stuck (positions 4–12): Z (this is the key number)

Label each with:
- Good / Watch / Action Needed

### 2.3 “Why” Explanation
Example:
“Most tracked keywords are ranking on page 2. Titles and page intent appear misaligned with current SERP leaders.”

This explanation should be derived from:
- Position clustering
- CTR mismatches
- Competitor dominance (later integration)

### 2.4 Recommended Next Action
Example:
Recommended Actions:
1) Optimize titles/meta for 7 keywords ranking in positions 5–10
2) Expand content depth on /therapy-orlando page
3) Add internal links from high-authority pages

Do NOT list more than 3 actions on the dashboard.

---

## 3) Technical SEO Section – Revised Spec

### 3.1 Status Header
Example:
Technical SEO — Critical ⚠  
Indexation issues detected

### 3.2 KPI Snapshot (Impact-Weighted)
Group issues by impact, not by type.

Example:
- Indexation blockers: 3 (Critical)
- On-page issues: 18 (Warning)
- Performance issues: None (Good)

### 3.3 “Why” Explanation
Example:
“3 service pages are marked noindex, preventing them from ranking. This likely contributes to recent traffic loss.”

### 3.4 Recommended Next Action
Example:
Recommended Actions:
1) Remove noindex from /services/anxiety-therapy
2) Fix duplicate titles on 12 pages
3) Re-submit sitemap after fixes

---

## 4) Top-Level Dashboard (Overview Page) – Critical Changes

### 4.1 Replace Neutral Cards with Decision Cards
Each pillar card must show:
- Status
- Primary reason
- One next action

Example card content:
Website Traffic — Needs Attention  
↓ Non-branded traffic down 18%  
Action: Review top losing pages

This allows the user to decide **where to click first**.

### 4.2 Remove “Silent Tables”
Any table shown on the homepage must have:
- A highlighted insight row OR
- A callout above it explaining what matters

Example:
“Most keywords below are ranking outside the top 10. Focus on rows highlighted in yellow.”

---

## 5) Prescriptive Language Rules (Very Important)

- Never say: “Needs Attention” without saying why
- Never show a number without context
- Never force the user to infer priority
- Prefer verbs:
  - “Fix”
  - “Optimize”
  - “Investigate”
  - “Expand”
  - “Create”

---

## 6) Acceptance Criteria (Layout is Not Done Until…)

- A first-time user can land on the dashboard and know within 10 seconds:
  - Whether the site is healthy
  - What is broken
  - What to do first
- No section requires a click to understand urgency
- Every section ends with explicit next steps
- Clicking always moves from “what” → “how”, never from “what” → “why”

---

## 7) Implementation Guidance (Short)

- Add a lightweight “insight engine” layer that:
  - Interprets raw metrics into states
  - Selects 1–3 dominant causes
  - Maps causes to action templates
- Do not over-engineer scoring; clarity > precision
- Optimize for decision-making, not completeness

---

## Final Note

If this dashboard is working correctly, the user should *rarely* ask:
“What does this mean?”

They should instead ask:
“Do I agree with this recommendation?”

That’s the bar.
