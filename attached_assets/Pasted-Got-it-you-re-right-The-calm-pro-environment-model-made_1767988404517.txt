Got it — you’re right. The “calm pro + environment” model made everything *consistent*, but it also made everything feel **generic**, and for trades (especially HVAC/plumbing) you actually need **topic-specific stock** that screams the industry instantly.

Here are **dev-ready instructions** to switch the Examples page to **topic-based stock images** (with the right constraints so we don’t get weird/cheesy/uncanny images again).

# Switch Example Images to Topic-Based Stock (Industry-Specific) — Dev Instructions

## Goal

Replace current generic “home exterior” style images with **topic-specific stock images** that:

* Instantly communicate the industry in <1 second
* Still feel **website-marketing friendly**
* Avoid cringe, staged, or overly technical images

We want: **recognizable + professional + conversion-friendly**

---

## Image Model (Updated)

Each industry must use one of these **acceptable archetypes**:

### Archetype A — Technician + Context (Preferred for Trades)

* Technician visible
* Context clearly shows the service (unit, tools, truck, uniform)
* Must be *calm/light action*, not sweaty repair drama

### Archetype B — Finished Result / Customer Outcome (Preferred for Landscaping)

* Finished yard, clean exterior, clear “after” look

### Archetype C — Customer-Facing Space (Preferred for Clinics)

* Reception, lobby, clean office vibe
* Optional smiling staff (not procedures)

---

## Hard “Do Not Use” Rules

Reject any image with:

* Interiors unrelated to the topic (couches, random rooms)
* Close-up wiring / gauges / ducts (feels like a repair manual)
* Overly staged stock models (clipboard smiles)
* Medical procedures (dental tools, open mouths)
* Visible brand logos or signage
* Cartoonish / uncanny / AI-looking photos

---

## Where to Source

### Option 1 (Preferred): Curated Unsplash/Pexels

* Use their APIs OR manually select and store locally

### Option 2: Manual curation + local storage (recommended short-term)

* Download 3–5 approved images per category
* Store in `/public/examples/images/{industry}/`

This prevents “random search results” from breaking quality.

## Exact Query Bank (Use These Verbatim)

### Plumbing

Use:

* `plumber fixing sink`
* `plumber service technician`
* `plumbing repair technician`
* `plumber with tools`
  Avoid:
* pipes close-up, under-sink darkness

### HVAC

Use:

* `hvac technician air conditioner`
* `hvac technician outdoor unit`
* `heating cooling technician`
* `hvac service truck technician`
  Avoid:
* wiring close-up, basement furnace rooms

### Dental Clinic

Use:

* `dental clinic reception`
* `dentist office lobby`
* `dentist smiling office`
  Avoid:
* procedures, tools, mouths

### Landscaping

Use:

* `landscaping crew yard`
* `landscaping finished backyard`
* `lawn care professional`
  Avoid:
* dirt digging, mud, shovels close-up

---

## Image Requirements (So They Look “Website Marketing Friendly”)

* Bright, natural lighting
* Clean composition
* No chaos, no clutter
* Subject framed like a hero image (space for overlay)
* High res (min 1600px wide)
* 16:9 crop with `object-fit: cover`

---

## Implementation Requirements

### 1) Update Example Data Model

Each card must specify `imageQuery` and a pinned fallback.

```ts
{
  industry: "HVAC",
  location: "Denver, CO",
  image: {
    source: "local", // or "unsplash"
    url: "/examples/images/hvac/hvac-tech-outdoor-unit.jpg",
    query: "hvac technician outdoor unit"
  }
}
```

### 2) Pin “Approved Images” (Don’t Randomize in Production)

Random results will keep breaking quality.

**Rule:** Use a **curated pinned image per industry** now.
Later we can rotate among approved images.

### 3) Add Overlay (Keep This)

Keep your overlay label:

* `{Industry} Website · {City, State}`

But slightly reduce opacity so it doesn’t scream.

### 4) Keep Layout Constraints

Keep the fixed image height, anchored CTAs, and pill max-height alignment rules you already implemented.

---

## Workflow for the Team (Fast + Repeatable)

1. For each industry, pull 10 images using the query bank
2. Reject anything that violates the “Do Not Use” rules
3. Pick the best 1–2 per industry
4. Save locally in the repo
5. Update the example config to point to those pinned images
6. Commit

---

## Acceptance Test (Must Pass)

* Hide text overlays for a second
* Ask: “Can I identify the industry instantly?”
* If HVAC looks like “a house” or “a room” → fail
* If plumbing looks like “a kitchen” → fail
* If dental looks like “medical” (procedures) → fail
* If landscaping looks like “dirt work” not outcome → fail

---

## Immediate Fix Recommendation (What to do right now)

For HVAC and Plumbing, the best bet is:

* Technician + outdoor unit (HVAC)
* Technician + sink / pipe under good lighting (plumbing)

That will read correctly instantly and still feel like a marketing hero image.
