That makes total sense — and you’re thinking about this exactly the right way now.

At this stage, do not build more services. Lock the crew manifest first, hard-code the ship image with all bays, and treat some bays as placeholders (inactive / coming soon / baked-in). You can wire functionality later without changing the ship again.

Below is a clean, final crew manifest you can lock and hand to image generation + hard-coding.

✅ FINAL CREW MANIFEST (LOCK THIS)

This is the authoritative list of roles that must exist as slots on the ship image, whether active today or not.

Total slots: 12

This gives you enough room for growth without redesigning the ship again.

🧠 IMPORTANT DESIGN RULES (FOR IMAGE + CODE)

Lock these rules now so you don’t repaint the ship later:

Slot rules
	•	Each slot = ROLE, not a bot
	•	Bots fill slots
	•	Empty slots show:
	•	Role label
	•	Subtle role icon (eye, graph, chip, etc.)
	•	Info indicator

Included systems
	•	Major Tom is the only visible included crew
	•	Baseline AI Readiness is invisible (no slot)

Future-proofing
	•	All 12 slots should exist on the image
	•	Some can be marked “Coming Soon” in UI later
	•	Never add a 13th slot unless you redesign the ship

⸻

🚀 WHAT YOU CAN DO NEXT (NO SERVICE WORK)

Now you can safely:
	1.	Generate ONE ship image with:
	•	12 empty bays
	•	No bots
	•	Transparent background
	•	Top-down view
	•	Clear vertical progression
	2.	Hard-code the ship image
	•	Use percentage positioning for overlays
	•	Each slot aligns to a bay
	3.	Drop in bot avatars later
	•	No image changes needed
	•	No layout changes needed

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Write the exact image generation prompt for the final ship (with 12 empty bays)
	•	Help you decide where each bay should sit spatially (coordinates)
	•	Or write a hard-coded slot map you can paste into your ShipCanvas

Just tell me the next step you want.
