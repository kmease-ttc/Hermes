Replit Prompt: Normalize Severity & Effort Chips to Match “High” Style (Filled Glass + Solid Text)

Context
In the Action Queue cards, the “High” severity chip is styled correctly:

* Light translucent background (glass)
* Text in the same hue at full opacity
* No outline
* Premium, readable, consistent with My Crew

However, other chips (Medium, Quick, etc.) are currently white or outlined and visually inconsistent.

Goal
All **severity and effort chips** must use the **same visual pattern as “High”**, differing only by color — not structure or opacity rules.

---

## Correct Chip Style (Canonical Pattern)

Use this pattern for **ALL** chips:

* Background: light translucent fill of the chip’s semantic color (≈15–20% opacity)
* Text: same color at **100% opacity**
* Border: none (or extremely subtle inner border)
* Rounded pill
* Same font size, weight, and padding across all chips

This is a **filled-glass chip**, not an outline or solid badge.

---

## Apply This Pattern To

### Severity Chips

* High (already correct – do not change)
* Medium
* Low (if present)

Color mapping:

* High → red family
* Medium → amber/yellow family
* Low → green family

Each severity chip:

* `bg: color @ 15–20%`
* `text: color @ 100%`

---

### Effort Chips

* Quick
* Medium
* Slow (if present)

Effort chips should:

* Follow the SAME pattern
* Use a neutral or cool color family (gray/blue)
* Still be filled-glass, not white or outlined

---

## Explicitly Remove

* White-filled chips
* Outline-only chips
* Mixed opacity text/background combinations
* Chips that don’t match the “High” visual treatment

---

## Implementation Notes

* Centralize chip styling in a shared component or utility:

  * e.g. `<StatusChip type="severity" level="high" />`
* Pass only the color token; styling logic should be shared.
* Do not hardcode colors inline per chip.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* “High”, “Medium”, and “Quick” all look like variations of the same chip
* The only difference between chips is **color**, not structure
* Chips feel premium, consistent, and readable on dark glass cards
* The Action Queue looks visually coherent and intentional

This is a visual normalization task only.
Do not change copy, layout, or behavior.
