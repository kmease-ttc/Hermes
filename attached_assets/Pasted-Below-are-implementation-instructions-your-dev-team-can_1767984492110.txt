Below are implementation instructions your dev team can execute now, using the current Arclo site design as-is (keep branding, colors, typography, layout style), but upgrading structure, clarity, trust, and conversion. This is written to be immediately actionable.

GOAL
Increase signup conversion by:
	1.	Making the promise instantly understandable (website in 60 seconds + SEO runs itself)
	2.	Making it believable (examples, transparency, proof)
	3.	Reducing perceived risk (free preview, cancel anytime, activity log)
	4.	Showing “what happens after signup” (simple workflow + cadence)

PRIORITY ORDER (SHIP IN THIS SEQUENCE)
Phase 0 (1–2 days): Homepage restructure + Examples gallery stub
Phase 1 (2–4 days): “How it works” + comparison section + trust blocks
Phase 2 (3–6 days): Dashboard “Activity Log” + simple reporting + approvals toggle (optional)
Phase 3 (later): Agency checker lead magnet + deeper local SEO add-ons

PHASE 0: HOMEPAGE RESTRUCTURE (NO REBRAND, USE CURRENT COMPONENTS)
	1.	Hero section: tighten copy + clarify primary CTA

	•	Keep existing hero layout and styling.
	•	Update hero headline to emphasize autonomy first, speed second:
H1: “Autonomous SEO for local businesses.”
Subhead: “Get a professional website in 60 seconds. Arclo keeps your SEO and content improving automatically so more customers find and call you.”
	•	Primary CTA button: “Generate My Site”
	•	Secondary CTA text link: “See examples”
	•	Add a one-line friction reducer directly under CTA: “No credit card required.”

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Above the fold includes H1, subhead, primary CTA, “no credit card” reassurance, and one trust line (next step).

	2.	Add a “Trust strip” directly under hero (1 row, 3–5 items)

	•	Use current design language (small icons optional, but don’t change aesthetic).
	•	Items should be outcomes and risk reducers, not features:
	•	“Built for local service businesses”
	•	“Cancel anytime”
	•	“Your changes logged and visible”
	•	“SEO best practices, automated”
	•	“Fast, mobile-friendly websites”

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Visible without scrolling too far (should be within first viewport on desktop).

	3.	Insert “How it works” as a 3-step section (directly after trust strip)

	•	Keep it extremely simple, 3 cards in a row.
Card titles:
	1.	“Answer 6 quick questions”
	2.	“Arclo generates your site”
	3.	“Arclo improves it every week”
Card body copy should be 1 sentence each.
	•	Add a small line under the 3 cards: “You can review major changes before they go live (optional).”

Acceptance criteria:
	•	This section should take <10 seconds to understand.
	•	Includes a CTA at end: “Generate My Site”.

	4.	Replace or rewrite the current feature bullets into “Benefits first” tiles

	•	Use the same component style you already have for feature lists, but reword:
	•	“More calls from Google”
	•	“SEO and content handled for you”
	•	“No tools, no reports, no guessing”
	•	“See every update Arclo makes”
	•	“Designed for your industry”
	•	“Ongoing improvements (not a one-time site)”

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Each tile = 3–6 word headline + 1 sentence explanation.
	•	No jargon (avoid “schema”, “meta tags”, “backlinks” on homepage).

	5.	Add a “Who it’s for” section (keep your industries list, but make it scannable)

	•	Keep the current industries list but convert to:
	•	A grid with icons OR
	•	Pills/badges in multiple columns
	•	Add a short intro line: “Arclo is built for businesses that serve customers locally.”

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The section visually reads as “this is for me” in 2 seconds.

	6.	Add a new homepage section: “Examples” preview (4 thumbnails)

	•	Create a lightweight examples component now (even with placeholders).
	•	Show 4 example website cards:
	•	Plumbing
	•	HVAC
	•	Dental / Clinic
	•	Landscaping
Each card includes:
	•	Screenshot (or placeholder)
	•	Industry label
	•	“View demo” link

Implementation shortcut:
	•	If you don’t have real screenshots yet, generate 4 demo sites internally and screenshot the homepages.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Clicking any example opens a demo page (Phase 0 can be static /examples page).
	•	Add “See all examples” link to /examples.

	7.	Add a “Why Arclo vs tools vs agencies” comparison section (lightweight v1)

	•	Don’t build a complex table yet. Use 3 columns with 4 rows of short text.
Columns: “DIY Tools”, “SEO Agencies”, “Arclo”
Rows:
	•	Skill required
	•	Time required
	•	Transparency
	•	Ongoing optimization

Acceptance criteria:
	•	This must be skimmable. Keep each cell to <8 words.

	8.	Add a bottom CTA section (repeat conversion)

	•	Header: “Ready to never think about SEO again?”
	•	CTA: “Generate My Site”
	•	Subtext: “Free preview. No credit card.”

PHASE 0: NEW PAGE /examples (SHIP FAST)
Route: /examples
Purpose: credibility + clarity.

Page structure:
	1.	Header: “Real examples of Arclo-built sites”
	2.	Grid of 8–12 example cards (start with 4 if needed)
Each card:

	•	Screenshot
	•	Industry + City (can be fictional)
	•	Buttons: “View demo” and “Generate my site like this”

MVP for demos:
	•	Demos can be static snapshots or live demo subdomains.
	•	If live demos are too heavy now, use a modal with 3–5 screenshots per example.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	This page exists, is linked from nav and homepage, and looks consistent with your branding.

PHASE 1: ADD TRUST + BELIEVABILITY (MINIMAL BACKEND)
	1.	Add /how-it-works page (optional if homepage section is strong)
Route: /how-it-works
Content expands the 3 steps into a simple story.
Include:

	•	“What Arclo does automatically” (bulleted, plain English)
	•	“What you control” (edits, approvals toggle)
	•	“What results to expect” (set realistic expectations: “SEO is compounding; expect improvement over weeks, not hours.”)

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Must include screenshots of dashboard activity log (can be mock UI screenshot initially).

	2.	Add /pricing page (even if single plan)
Route: /pricing
You can ship a single plan now:

	•	Plan name: “Autopilot”
	•	Price
	•	Includes list (website, hosting, SEO, content updates)
	•	FAQ block: cancel anytime, domain, support, trial/preview.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Pricing is not hidden behind “contact us.”

	3.	Add homepage testimonial slot (even if just 1–2)
If you don’t have real customer testimonials yet:

	•	Use “Founder note” block instead of fake testimonials:
“We built Arclo after getting burned by agencies and overwhelmed by tools…”
This builds trust without inventing testimonials.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	No fake social proof.

PHASE 2: DASHBOARD SUPPORTS THE PROMISE (PRODUCT ALIGNMENT)
Your website promise is “we do it for you” + “you can see what we did.”
So the dashboard must show two things clearly: Progress + Work Done.
	1.	Add “Activity Log” component to dashboard (must-have)
Route: /app (or wherever your dashboard lives)
Top layout:

	•	3 KPI tiles:
	•	“Google visibility” (impressions or a simplified score)
	•	“Website traffic”
	•	“Leads / calls” (even if manual tracking in v1)
Below: Activity log feed

Activity log items examples:
	•	“Published a new service page: Water Heater Repair”
	•	“Improved page speed on mobile”
	•	“Updated page titles for ‘Emergency Plumber in Austin’”
	•	“Published a new article: How to prevent pipe leaks in winter”
Each entry includes:
	•	Date
	•	Action type label (Content / Technical / SEO)
	•	“View” link to see what changed

Acceptance criteria:
	•	A user can answer “what did Arclo do for me this week?” in 10 seconds.

	2.	Add “Autopilot level” toggle (optional but strong for trust)
Settings:

	•	Autopilot ON (default)
	•	Autopilot ON + approve major changes
	•	Autopilot OFF (manual approve)

Major changes definition for v1:
	•	Publishing new pages
	•	Publishing blog posts
	•	Large homepage content edits

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Default is simple. Don’t force choices in onboarding. Put this in settings.

	3.	Add “Monthly summary” email (simple)
Even without perfect metrics, send:

	•	of actions completed
	•	of new pages/posts
	•	Basic traffic/search visibility delta (if integrated)
This is retention fuel and reinforces value.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Email sends automatically once per month.

PHASE 3: LEAD MAGNET THAT DIRECTLY HITS THE “AGENCY TRUST” WEDGE
Route: /agency-checker or /free-audit
“Enter your website. We’ll scan it and tell you what’s being missed (and what Arclo fixes automatically).”
Output:
	•	Simple score + 6 prioritized issues
	•	CTA: “Fix these automatically with Arclo”

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Collect email before showing full report (optional) OR show summary then ask for email for details.

TECH/UX RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	1.	No SEO jargon on marketing pages. Translate everything into outcomes.
	2.	Every page has a primary CTA: “Generate My Site”.
	3.	Proof beats claims: examples page + activity log are your “believability engine.”
	4.	Keep pages short. Use scannable sections, cards, and short paragraphs.
	5.	Mobile-first spacing: the ICP will often view on phones.

NAVIGATION UPDATE (MATCH CURRENT DESIGN)
Header nav should be:
	•	Examples
	•	How it works
	•	Pricing
	•	Login
Primary CTA button always visible: “Generate My Site”

FOOTER
	•	Industries (link to /examples filtered if possible)
	•	Company (About)
	•	Legal (Privacy, Terms)
	•	Contact

MEASUREMENT (SET THIS UP NOW)
Add event tracking for:
	•	CTA clicks (Generate My Site)
	•	Example demo views
	•	Signup start / completion
	•	Pricing page views
	•	Login clicks
	•	Scroll depth on homepage (optional)

Acceptance criteria:
	•	You can see conversion funnel: Landing → CTA → Generate flow → Signup.

DEFINITION OF DONE (WHAT “BROUGHT TOGETHER” MEANS)
When you ship Phase 0 + Phase 1, the site should:
	•	Explain Arclo in 10 seconds
	•	Prove it visually (examples)
	•	Show how it works (3 steps)
	•	Reduce trust friction (comparison + cancel anytime + transparency promise)
	•	Drive one action repeatedly (Generate My Site)

If you want, paste your current page sections (or share screenshots) and I’ll map these changes onto your exact existing component layout so your devs can implement without redesign debates.
