You are a senior frontend engineer and design-system enforcer working inside this Replit project. Your task is to **finish polishing the Scan Preview / Report page so it feels fully cohesive, premium, and intentional**, with no leftover inconsistencies.

This is a **UI / layout / design-system pass only**.
Do **not** change scan logic, calculations, or backend behavior.

## OBJECTIVE (what “done” feels like)

The page should feel like:

* A modern product, not a collection of widgets
* One unified design language
* Brand-forward and confident
* Conversion-oriented but trustworthy

Right now it’s improved, but still feels **partially applied**. Fix that.

---

## DESIGN SYSTEM RULES (LOCK THESE IN)

### 1. Button hierarchy (strict)

**Primary CTA**

* Use the **brand gradient** (same as “Analyze My Website”)
* Only for:

  * Analyze My Website
  * Fix Everything Automatically
* Never use green for these.

**Secondary CTA**

* Use the **secondary accent (blue/teal)**
* Used for:

  * Generate My Site
  * Fix This (on individual cards)
* Must be consistent everywhere.

**Success / Completed**

* Green ONLY for:

  * Completed
  * Good
  * Healthy
* Green must never be a CTA color.

If a button is green and not “Completed”, it’s wrong.

---

### 2. Glass system must be applied everywhere (no exceptions)

You already created glass tokens — now **use them universally**.

#### Required glass layers:

* `glass.panelFocus` → hero / diagnosis section
* `glass.panel` → section containers
* `glass.card` → all cards (checks, categories, metrics)

No flat white cards.
No default background cards.
No ad-hoc shadows.

If a section looks “flat”, it’s missing glass.

---

### 3. Card layout normalization (critical)

All category cards (Technical SEO, Core Web Vitals, Content Quality, etc.) must:

* Be **equal height**
* Use `flex flex-col`
* Have structure:

  * Header (icon + title + status)
  * Body (description)
  * Footer (CTA)
* CTA footer must use `mt-auto`
* All “Fix This” buttons must:

  * Same height
  * Same padding
  * Same alignment
  * Same variant

Buttons must line up horizontally across cards.

---

### 4. Iconography consistency

Every card must:

* Have one clear icon
* Icon must be colored intentionally
* No gray icons

Color rules:

* Success → green
* Warning → gold / amber
* Neutral / system → brand purple

Icons are part of the hierarchy — treat them that way.

---

## SPECIFIC FIXES TO MAKE NOW

### A. Remove remaining green CTA usage

* Search for:

  * `bg-green`
  * `text-green`
  * emerald/green gradients on buttons
* Replace with:

  * `primaryGradient`
  * `secondaryAccent`
* Green is allowed ONLY on:

  * status pills
  * checkmarks
  * “Good” indicators

---

### B. Fully apply glass to lower sections

* The hero section looks correct.
* The sections below (“What We Checked”, category cards, metrics) must:

  * Use `glass.panel` for containers
  * Use `glass.card` for cards
* Ensure consistent blur, border, and shadow.

If you scroll and anything feels visually “lighter” or disconnected, it’s wrong.

---

### C. Strengthen hierarchy between diagnosis and details

* Add more vertical spacing after the hero panel.
* Reduce visual dominance of section headers compared to the hero.
* The user should understand the diagnosis **before** reading details.

---

### D. Micro-copy polish (small but impactful)

Add subtle, human clarifiers:

* Under the main CTA:

  * “Safe mode enabled • No destructive changes • Review before publish”
* Under the loss statement:

  * “Sites with similar grades typically see gains after addressing these issues”

This increases trust and conversion.

---

## OUT OF SCOPE (do NOT touch)

* Scan logic
* Data accuracy
* Backend APIs
* Publishing flow
* Pricing

This is purely **visual + layout + consistency**.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before finishing, verify:

* No green CTA buttons remain
* Primary CTA matches Analyze My Website gradient
* Secondary CTAs are consistently blue/teal
* All cards are equal height
* All Fix This buttons align perfectly
* Glass styling is consistent top-to-bottom
* Page feels like one product, not mixed styles

If anything feels “default SaaS” — keep refining.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

When unsure:

> Copy the **best-looking glass panel** on the page
> and make everything else behave like it.

Consistency > novelty.

Finish the polish.
