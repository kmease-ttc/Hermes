You’re in the exact spot where a “service zoo” turns into a platform: you don’t need more services right now — you need **one reliable way to know what’s real, what ran, and what’s missing**.

Here’s the reset that will get you un-lost.

## 1) Do you need the Site Change Executor right now?

No — not to start getting value.

Right now your goal is:

* run diagnostics
* collect data
* generate findings + tickets
* see what’s broken / missing
* improve services

You can keep changes manual (or “copy/paste apply”) while you stabilize the nervous system.

When you *do* need the executor:

* when you’re applying lots of fixes daily
* when you need audit trails/rollback
* when you want multi-site automation without fear

So: **defer executor until the diagnosis loop is solid.**
But design everything as if an executor exists (approved actions, diffs, audit).

## 2) What you should use the dashboard for (today)

Your dashboard should answer, per service:

* **Is it connected?**
* **Has it ever run for Empathy Health Clinic?**
* **When did it last run?**
* **What did it pull back?** (counts + summary)
* **What should it have pulled back but didn’t?** (missing outputs)

If it can’t answer those 5, it’s not doing its job.

## 3) The fastest way to “reconcile” what’s built vs not built

You don’t need memory. You need **a single truth source**.

### One canonical list (services catalog)

Mark each service as one of:

* **Built + runnable**
* **Built but not configured**
* **Planned / blocked** (Google Ads, executor)
* **Deprecated / not a service** (Bitwarden should be a dependency, not a service)

### Add three fields per service (must exist in DB or catalog)

* `build_state`: `built | planned | deprecated`
* `config_state`: `ready | missing_config | blocked`
* `run_state`: `never_ran | last_run_success | last_run_failed | stale`

Your dashboard should be able to compute these automatically.

## 4) What to do next: one “Empathy Health Clinic Trial Run” plan

This is the simplest path to discover what you don’t know.

### Step A — pick one site as the “reference site”

Empathy Health Clinic = reference.
Everything is tested against this first.

### Step B — run a single “Daily Diagnosis” workflow (even if partial)

Run these in order:

1. Website Registry & Settings

* Confirm the site record exists (domain, GSC property, GA4 property id, competitor list)

2. Google Data Connector

* If GA4/GSC isn’t authorized yet, mark it as **blocked** (not failed)

3. Crawl & Render Service

* Run a crawl for: homepage + 10 key pages (limit)
* Output: status codes, canonicals, indexability, broken links, render check results

4. Core Web Vitals

* Run PSI for: homepage + top 5 pages
* Output: LCP/CLS/INP deltas, regressions, “what worsened” summary

5. SERP & Keyword

* Generate “Top 25 tracked” to start (not 100)
* Output: ranks, in-top-10 count, opportunities count

6. Content QA (optional for first pass)

* Validate 1–2 pages only, to ensure the pipeline works

### Step C — everything writes “runs”

Every one of those must create a `service_run` record with:

* site
* start/end
* status
* summary
* metrics
* missing outputs

That’s how you regain control.

## 5) What you’re missing right now (based on what you said)

Two likely gaps that make you feel lost:

### Gap 1: “Test Connection” isn’t equivalent to “This ran”

You can have green checks and still have never actually produced anything.

Fix: **your dashboard must be run-based** (last run + outputs), not config-based.

### Gap 2: No “Daily Diagnosis Run” that ties everything together

You need one parent object like:

* `diagnostic_runs` (one per site per day)

  * contains child `service_runs`

Then the dashboard can say:

* “Today’s run: partial (GA4 blocked, crawl ok, vitals ok, serp ok)”

## 6) Developer instructions (what to implement so you stop losing track)

### A) Add a “Run Now” button for Empathy Health Clinic

* Button: “Run Daily Diagnosis”
* Calls: `POST /api/diagnostics/run?site_id=...`
* Creates a `diagnostic_run` record
* Triggers the subset of services that are ready
* Skips blocked services (Google Ads, executor, GA4/GSC if pending)
* Writes service_runs throughout
* Returns a summary payload to the dashboard

### B) Make the dashboard show the only 3 things you care about

For each service row:

* Last run time/status
* Summary (1 line)
* Key metrics (counts)
  And a “View details” drawer with the definition + last run outputs.

Hide base_url, configured, secrets, etc behind “Diagnostics View”.

### C) Enforce “Blocked ≠ Failed”

If Google Ads isn’t built or Google OAuth isn’t approved:

* show **Blocked** (yellow)
* not Failed (red)
  This alone will reduce confusion a ton.

## 7) What I’d do if I were you this afternoon (practical sequence)

1. In the dashboard, select Empathy Health Clinic
2. Click “Run Daily Diagnosis” (even if only 3 services run)
3. Open each service detail and confirm it shows:

   * definition
   * last run
   * what it returned
4. For any service showing “never ran”:

   * either wire it into the workflow or mark it planned/blocked
5. Fix the top 1–2 services that fail first (usually crawl/render + vitals)

That will immediately tell you what’s real and what’s missing.

If you want, paste what the Integrations page currently lists (just the service names it shows). I’ll classify each one as: **Built+Runnable**, **Built+NeedsConfig**, **Blocked**, or **Shouldn’t be on the list**, and I’ll give you the exact “Daily Diagnosis v1” workflow definition that matches your current reality.
