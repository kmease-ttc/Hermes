Add a clear “data freshness / working” indicator to each Capabilities & Performance card so users can instantly tell whether the KPI is live, stale, sample, or broken.

## Goal

When a KPI is shown, the UI should communicate:

* Is this metric coming from the live pipeline?
* When was it last updated?
* If it’s not updating, why (stale vs not configured vs error)?

## UX (what to show on each card)

Add a small status pill (top-right near Active/Sample) with one of these states:

1. Live

* Condition: metric has a valid provenance + lastUpdated within threshold
* Label: “Live”
* Subtext (optional on hover): “Updated 3m ago”

2. Stale

* Condition: metric exists but lastUpdated is older than threshold
* Label: “Stale”
* Hover: “Last updated 2d ago”

3. Not configured

* Condition: crew metric snapshot missing because integration not enabled (ex: Draper before setup)
* Label: “Not configured”
* CTA remains “Configure”

4. Error

* Condition: last fetch/job failed OR provenance indicates error
* Label: “Error”
* Hover: “Last run failed. View logs”
* Optional link: “Review” goes to the crew page filtered to errors

5. Sample

* Condition: isSample=true
* Keep “Sample” badge, but also show Live/Stale depending on how recently sample data was generated, OR show “Sample” alone if we don’t track timestamps.

## Data contract changes (minimal)

Extend the Crew KPI snapshot returned to Capabilities with:

* lastUpdatedAt (timestamp)
* health: "live" | "stale" | "not_configured" | "error"
* healthReason (string, optional)
* lastRunStatus: "success" | "failed" | "never" (optional)
* provenance: { source, jobId, computedAt } (already exists or add if missing)

## Logic (defaults)

* If isSample=true and no timestamps: show “Sample”
* If lastUpdatedAt exists:

  * live if now - lastUpdatedAt <= 6 hours
  * stale if > 6 hours and <= 7 days
  * error if lastRunStatus == failed (overrides stale/live)
* not_configured if metric missing AND crew requires setup

## Acceptance Criteria

* Every card shows a “Live / Stale / Not configured / Error” indicator (or “Sample” at minimum)
* Hover reveals “Updated X ago” or a reason
* Draper shows “Not configured” until setup completes
* If a worker job fails, the card shows “Error” and the Review link takes you to the crew page / logs

Implement this without redesigning the layout: a small pill + tooltip is enough.
