FINAL CREW SHIP EXECUTION — LOCK GRID, PRESERVE APPROVED CREW CARDS, ADD EMPTY-SLOT VALUE PROPS

Context:
We are extremely close. We have the approved crew cards (cartoon bots + gold outline) and the approved empty-slot styling (+ Add crew).
We must now lock the ship to a deterministic layout and add value props for empty slots.

STOP ALL NEW DESIGN GENERATION. This is purely execution.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Keep the existing CrewCard component EXACTLY as-is (size, border, avatar scale, typography, badge placement).
- Use a fixed grid layout to prevent overlap and drift.
- Empty slots must be full-size tiles with role icon + role name + “+ Add crew” + short value prop.
- Do not change the ship background image, only layer content on top.

========================================
1) LOCKED SHIP GRID (DESKTOP)
========================================
Implement the ship slots as a fixed grid overlay (no absolute scatter).

Grid:
- 4 columns x 4 rows
- gap-x: 28px
- gap-y: 32px
- all tiles same size (use current tile size)
- grid is centered over the ship background

Slot map:

Row 1:
- Col 2: Mission Control (Major Tom)

Row 2:
- Col 1: Competitive Intelligence (Natasha)
- Col 2: SERP Tracking (Lookout slot)
- Col 3: Analytics & Signals (Popular slot)
- Col 4: Analytics & Signals (Popular)

Row 3:
- Col 1: Technical SEO (Scotty)
- Col 2: Performance Monitoring (Speedster)
- Col 3: Content Decay (Sentinel)
- Col 4: Content Strategy (Hemingway)

Row 4:
- Col 1: Domain Authority (Beacon)
- Col 2: AI Optimization (Atlas)
- Col 3: Paid Ads (Draper)
- Col 4: Knowledge Base (Socrates)

Rules:
- If a crew member is enabled, render their CrewCard in that slot.
- If not enabled, render the EmptySlotCard in that slot.
- No slot is ever hidden.

========================================
2) EMPTY SLOT CARD CONTENT (VALUE PROP INSIDE TILE)
========================================
Empty slots MUST contain a short value prop line below “+ Add crew”.

Empty slot card layout inside the tile:
- top-left: info icon (tooltip)
- center: role icon
- role name (grey)
- “+ Add crew” (small CTA, grey)
- value prop (1 short line, muted grey) (max 50–60 chars, truncate if needed)

Value props (exact copy):
- SERP Tracking: “Track rankings and explain movement.”
- Analytics & Signals: “Tie SEO work to traffic outcomes.”
- Technical SEO: “Find crawl/render issues blocking rank.”
- Performance Monitoring: “Fix speed issues hurting conversion.”
- AI Optimization: “Make your site discoverable to AI.”
- Paid Ads: “Turn learnings into faster growth.”
- Knowledge Base: “Store insights and learn over time.”

Empty slots must look clickable:
- dashed border
- subtle hover brighten
- clicking opens modal for that role

========================================
3) TYPOGRAPHY
========================================
- Crew names and role labels should be grey (text-secondary), not bright white.
- Value prop should be even more muted (text-muted).
- Do NOT change the typography of the crew cards beyond color (keep size/weight).

========================================
4) RESPONSIVE
========================================
- Desktop (>=1280px): fixed grid
- Tablet: 2 columns, preserve same slot order top→bottom, left→right
- Mobile: 1 column, same order

========================================
5) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
========================================
Done when:
- Layout matches the last screenshot, but is now deterministic (grid-based, no drift)
- Every empty slot contains its value prop + “Add crew”
- All tiles remain consistent size
- No overlap is possible
- No design/style regressions to crew cards
