ARC GLOW / REPLIT BUILD PROMPT
Project: Hermes (Dashboard) — Build “My Crew” Page (Ship + Roles + Bonuses)
Context: We are implementing this inside Hermes FIRST (dashboard app). Later we will reuse the same components for the Arclo marketing site, but do NOT implement marketing pages yet. Focus only on Hermes.

IMPORTANT: I will attach a reference image (the latest rendering we liked). Use it as the visual target for layout and density. Preserve Hermes styling (fonts, spacing, colors) and apply a dark theme with gold + silver accents, and a lighter ship illustration on a dark background.

GOAL
Create a new interactive “My Crew” page in Hermes that shows:
- Above the fold: a compact Status/Progress card on the left + the Ship canvas on the right
- Below the fold: long-form cards for Active Capabilities and Set Bonuses / Unlocks
The ship is a compartmentalized layout where each role slot can be clicked to preview/enable an agent. As crew is selected/enabled, bonuses change from transparent/locked to partially lit to fully active.

SCOPE
1) Add route/page in Hermes:
   - Route: /crew  (or /app/crew if that’s Hermes convention)
   - Add nav item in sidebar: “My Crew” (keep current label) linking to this page.

2) Implement UI structure matching the reference image but with LESS density above the fold:
   Above fold layout:
   - Left: STATUS + NEXT RECOMMENDED CREW MEMBER card (single card, compact)
   - Right: SHIP CANVAS (light ship on dark background, with distinct rooms/compartments)
   Below fold layout:
   - Two columns of long form cards (stack on mobile):
     Left column: Active Capabilities (grouped)
     Right column: Set Bonuses (locked/partial/active)

3) Implement interactive ship role slots and drawer:
   - Clicking a ship room opens a right-side drawer (Role Drawer)
   - Role Drawer shows: avatar, role name, description, status (enabled/needs config/locked/coming soon), price (if applicable), “What this unlocks” bullets, “Enable” button (or “Disable” if enabled), and “Select” (preview) toggle.
   - “Select” is preview-only (no billing) and changes slot state to “Selected” (semi-opaque).
   - “Enable” performs real enablement in Hermes (backend stub ok initially).

DATA + ROLES
We have the following crew avatars in attached_assets/generated_images/ with transparent backgrounds:
- captain_transparent.png — Captain (Orchestrator)
- socrates_transparent.png — Socrates (Knowledge & Learning)
- natasha_transparent.png — Natasha (Competitive Intelligence)
- scotty_transparent.png — Scotty (Technical SEO)
- beacon_transparent.png — Beacon (Authority / Trust)
- lookout_transparent.png — Lookout (SERP Tracker)
- speedster_transparent.png — Speedster (Performance)
- sentinel_transparent.png — Sentinel (Content Decay)
- hemingway_transparent.png — Hemingway (Content Strategy)
- draper_transparent.png — Draper (Ads)
- popular_transparent.png — Popular (Signals / Analytics)

ROLE SLOTS ON SHIP (COMPARTMENTS)
Ship should have distinct compartments/rooms. Each room maps to one role. Use these canonical role ids:
- captain (included, always active)
- socrates
- natasha
- scotty
- beacon
- lookout
- speedster
- sentinel
- hemingway
- draper
- popular

SLOT VISUAL STATES
Each ship compartment can be in one of three states:
1) Empty: faint silhouette (ghosted avatar at ~20% opacity), label, subtle outline
2) Selected (Preview): avatar at ~55% opacity, badge “Selected”
3) Enabled (Active): avatar at 100% opacity, badge “Active”, subtle gold glow

STATUS CARD (ABOVE THE FOLD, LEFT)
This is a single compact card containing ONLY:
A) Progress ring (gold + silver):
   - label: “62% Operational” (calculated)
   - also show “5 / 8 roles staffed” (calculated)
   - optional microcopy: “Ahead of X% of similar businesses” (can be placeholder for now)
B) Maturity badge:
   - Bronze / Silver / Gold / Best-in-Class based on operational %
   - one-line descriptor (e.g. “Strong foundation, missing execution depth”)
C) Next Recommended Crew Member:
   - Always show ONE recommendation
   - Show role + short value bullets
   - CTA button: “Add to Ship” (opens drawer + sets preview selected)

PROGRESS CALCULATIONS
- operationalPercent = round( enabledPaidRoles / totalPaidRoles * 100 )
- totalPaidRoles excludes captain and any “coming soon” roles
- enabledPaidRoles counts roles enabled in backend state (not preview selections)

BACKEND INTEGRATION (OK TO STUB NOW)
Create minimal endpoints/stubs if missing:
- GET /api/crew/state -> { enabledAgents: string[], agentStatus: { [id]: { health, needsConfig, lastRun } } }
- POST /api/crew/enable { agentId } -> returns updated state
- POST /api/crew/disable { agentId } -> returns updated state
If Hermes already has a service registry and enable/disable mechanism, reuse it.

BELOW THE FOLD CARDS

1) Active Capabilities (left column):
Render grouped capability cards, derived from enabled agents:
Examples groups (feel free to refine copy):
- Visibility Intelligence (Lookout + Natasha)
- Technical Intelligence (Scotty + Speedster)
- Authority & Trust (Beacon)
- Content Health (Sentinel)
- Content Strategy (Hemingway)
- Ads Intelligence (Draper)
- Signals / Analytics (Popular)
- Memory & Learning (Socrates)
Each group shows bullet items and status: Active / Partial / Locked.
Active if all required agents enabled; Partial if some enabled; Locked if none.

2) Set Bonuses / Unlocks (right column):
Implement “Diablo set bonus” mechanics in SaaS language:
Each set bonus has:
- title
- progress indicator: “Progress X / N”
- requirements list with checkmarks for enabled requirements, hollow for missing
- one-line value statement
States:
- Locked (0/N)
- Partial (1..N-1/N)
- Active (N/N)
Clicking any missing requirement should open that agent’s drawer.

Define initial set bonuses:
A) Revenue Attribution (example)
   - requirements: popular + lookout + natasha (optionally speedster later)
   - value: “See which SEO work drives traffic and conversions.”
B) Automated SEO Execution (placeholder for later Deployer)
   - requirements: scotty + hemingway + (deployer future)
   - value: “Generate tasks/PRs/content updates automatically.”
If Deployer isn’t in Hermes yet, keep this as “Coming soon” but still show it locked.

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
- Keep Hermes typography, spacing, buttons, and overall design language.
- Use dark background with gold + silver accents.
- Ship must be lighter than background and have distinct compartments.
- Reduce density above the fold: only status card + ship.
- No star map UI clutter; background can be subtle space texture but not busy.
- Avoid heavy animations; use simple transitions and subtle glow changes.

REUSE (FUTURE-PROOFING)
Build components so later we can reuse for marketing site by adding mode:
- mode="dashboard" (enable/disable works)
- mode="marketing" (preview only, “Sign in to enable” CTA)
Do not implement marketing pages now, just structure code so it’s easy later.

ANALYTICS (LIGHT)
Instrument events:
- crew_page_view
- crew_slot_click (agentId/roleId)
- crew_select_preview
- crew_enable_click
- crew_disable_click
- crew_recommendation_click
- set_bonus_click

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- /crew renders with status card + ship above fold, cards below fold
- Ship rooms are distinct, clickable, and reflect Empty/Selected/Active states
- Role drawer opens correctly and can toggle preview selection and enable state
- Progress ring + maturity badge update based on enabled roles
- Active Capabilities + Set Bonuses render below ship with proper locked/partial/active states
- Styling matches Hermes and reference image concept without being dense

NOTE
I will attach the reference UI image you should match, plus the transparent agent avatars. Use those assets directly.
