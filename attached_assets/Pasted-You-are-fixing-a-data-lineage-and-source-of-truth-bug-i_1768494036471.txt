You are fixing a **data lineage and source-of-truth bug** in the Arclo / Hermes crew system.

## Problem Summary

The **Capabilities & Performance dashboard** is rendering blank or placeholder values (e.g., dashes) for crew members, even though their **individual crew dashboards contain real metrics**.

Example:

* Scotty shows a dash on Capabilities & Performance
* Scotty shows **91% Crawl Health**, **88% Index Coverage**, **72% CWV**, etc. on his own dashboard

This indicates a **broken lineage between crew dashboards and the aggregate dashboard**.

## Core Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

Every metric shown on **Capabilities & Performance** MUST be:

1. Pulled directly from the **same source used by the crew member’s dashboard**
2. One-to-one mapped (no recomputation, no parallel logic)
3. Impossible to diverge or drift

If a value exists on the crew dashboard, it must appear identically on Capabilities & Performance.

---

## Architecture Rules to Implement

### 1. Establish a Single Source of Truth Per Crew Member

Each crew member must expose a canonical data object, for example:

```
crew_metrics[crew_id] = {
  primary_metric: {
    label: "Crawl Health",
    value: 91,
    unit: "%",
    status: "improving"
  },
  secondary_metrics: {...},
  last_updated: timestamp,
  is_sample: boolean
}
```

This object must be:

* Generated once
* Used by **both**:

  * Crew dashboard page
  * Capabilities & Performance cards

No duplicate metric calculations are allowed.

---

### 2. Explicit Metric Binding (No Implicit UI Logic)

Each Capabilities & Performance card must declare **exactly** which crew metric it binds to:

```
capabilities_card.scotty.metric_source = crew_metrics["scotty"].primary_metric
```

No placeholders, no hardcoded defaults, no UI-side guesses.

---

### 3. Remove Placeholder Rendering Logic

If a crew metric exists:

* Never show a dash
* Never show a blank bar
* Never show a fallback value

If a metric does NOT exist:

* Show a labeled state:

  * “Not configured”
  * “Sample data”
  * “Awaiting crawl”

But **never silently hide real data**.

---

### 4. Enforce Lineage at the Type Level

Introduce a shared interface / schema used by both views:

```
CrewMetric {
  label
  value
  unit
  trend
  status
  is_sample
}
```

Both dashboards must consume this interface directly.

If the interface breaks, the build should fail.

---

### 5. Sample Data Must Be Explicitly Marked

If a metric is sample or placeholder:

* It must be tagged `is_sample = true`
* The UI must render a visible “Sample” label

No unlabeled placeholders anywhere in the product.

---

### 6. Add a Guardrail Test

Add an automated check:

* For each crew member:

  * If crew dashboard metric exists
  * Then Capabilities & Performance must render the same value

Fail the test if:

* Value mismatches
* Value missing
* Value replaced with placeholder

---

## Success Criteria

* Scotty’s Capabilities card shows **the same 91% value** as Scotty’s dashboard
* Every crew member card is backed by real lineage
* No duplicated metric logic
* No silent placeholders
* One source of truth per crew member

Do not redesign the UI.
Do not invent new metrics.
Fix lineage only.
