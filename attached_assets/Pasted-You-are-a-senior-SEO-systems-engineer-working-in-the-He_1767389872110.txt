You are a senior SEO systems engineer working in the Hermes SEO / Arclo Replit codebase.

Goal
Bring **Sentinel (Content Decay Monitor)** up to the same level of completeness, clarity, and importance as **Scotty**. Sentinel is mission-critical for maintaining rankings over time and must not feel secondary or empty.

Sentinel’s mission
“Detect, prioritize, and reverse content decay before rankings and traffic are lost.”

Do **not** treat Sentinel as a generic content agent. It is a defensive, early-warning system.

---

## Part A — KPI / Metrics section (top of page)

Use the **same standardized KPI components and style guide** as Natasha, Lookout, and Scotty.

Sentinel KPIs must be:

1. **Decaying Pages**

* Definition: Number of URLs showing statistically significant ranking or traffic decline.
* Source: Content decay monitor worker.
* Value: integer
* Status:

  * Green = 0–2
  * Gold = 3–10
  * Red > 10

2. **Keywords at Risk**

* Definition: Count of keywords that dropped ≥ X positions or exited Top 10/20 in the last period.
* Source: Lookout keyword history.
* Value: integer

3. **Traffic Loss Risk**

* Definition: Estimated monthly traffic at risk from decaying pages.
* Source: keyword volume × rank delta heuristic.
* Value: integer (or rounded K)
* Always show a number (0 if none).

4. **Avg Decay Severity**

* Definition: Average severity score across all decaying pages.
* Source: decay monitor scoring.
* Value: numeric (0–100)

Remove any placeholder KPIs. No blanks allowed.

---

## Part B — Missions section

Sentinel missions should be **automatic, defensive, and priority-driven**.

Include:

1. **Detect Content Decay**

* Action: runs decay detection across indexed content.
* Output:

  * affected URLs
  * keywords impacted
  * severity score

2. **Prioritize Content Refresh**

* Action: rank decaying pages by:

  * traffic impact
  * keyword importance
  * effort estimate
* Output: ordered fix queue

3. **Refresh Content (Fix)**

* Action: queues refresh actions via SEO_DEPLOYER or content agents.
* Must support bulk execution.

Missions should show:

* needs attention badge
* count of affected items

---

## Part C — Findings tab (default)

This is Sentinel’s core surface.

Render a table of **Decaying Content**, grouped by severity:

Each row must include:

* URL
* Primary keyword(s)
* Previous rank → current rank
* Estimated traffic loss
* Decay severity (badge)
* Recommended action
* **Fix** button (if deployable)

Severity grouping:

* Critical (large drops, high-volume)
* Warning
* Mild

No empty states if data exists.

---

## Part D — Trends tab (Sentinel-specific)

Sentinel trends should answer:
“Are we stabilizing or bleeding?”

Track and render:

1. **Decaying Pages Over Time**

* Line or bar chart

2. **Keywords Lost vs Recovered**

* Two lines or stacked bars

3. **Traffic at Risk Trend**

* Line chart (monthly estimate)

4. **Fix Effectiveness**

* Pages refreshed → recovered rankings (simple before/after)

If no historical data exists:

* Show empty state with CTA: “Run Sentinel to begin tracking decay.”

---

## Part E — Controls / Fixes

* Fix buttons should:

  * Queue refresh actions
  * Show progress and completion
* Clearly label items that are:

  * Auto-fixable
  * Advisory only

---

## Part F — Validation rules

* Sentinel KPIs must never be blank.
* Sentinel counts must align with Lookout keyword history.
* Sentinel should not invent decay without rank movement evidence.
* After running Sentinel, KPIs, Findings, and Trends must all populate.

---

## Acceptance criteria

* Sentinel page feels as important and “serious” as Scotty.
* KPIs clearly show decay risk at a glance.
* Findings table is actionable.
* Trends provide real signal over time.
* Styling matches the global KPI standard exactly.
