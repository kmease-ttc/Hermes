Objective
Fix the **Additional Metrics** tab on the Speedster dashboard so it reliably displays data again (regression recovery). If the required data is not actually being returned by the API/worker, clearly detect that and surface a developer-visible message stating which fields are missing so we can update the worker.

Non-Negotiables

* Do not silently show empty cards.
* If the API returns data, render it.
* If the API does not return the data, explicitly report “Missing from API” (and list missing fields) so we can fix the worker.
* Page must still load (fallback to last snapshot if live call fails).

Step 1 — Identify What “Additional Metrics” Should Contain (Expected Fields)
Define the expected metrics for this tab (use whatever the UI is already trying to render; common set is):

* FCP (First Contentful Paint)
* TTFB (Time to First Byte)
* Speed Index
* Total Blocking Time (TBT)
* Page Weight / Requests (optional)
* Lighthouse/CrUX breakdowns if available

Do NOT invent new metrics. Use the metric keys currently referenced in the UI.

Step 2 — Diagnose Whether It’s a UI Binding Bug or Missing Worker Data
A) Inspect the Speedster API response used by the page (same endpoint as Core Vitals)

* Log (dev only) the raw payload for the Additional Metrics portion:

  * `console.log("speedster payload additionalMetrics", payload.additionalMetrics, payload.metrics, payload.lighthouse, payload.crux)`
* Check whether the data exists but is under a different key than the UI expects.

B) Confirm the snapshot stored in DB

* Load last snapshot and check if additional metrics exist there.
* If snapshot has it, but UI shows empty → UI mapping/binding regression.
* If snapshot does not have it and live API does not have it → worker is not returning it.

Step 3 — Fix the UI Normalization Layer (Most Likely)

* The Additional Metrics tab should render from the same normalized dashboard data shape as the Core Vitals tab.
* Update/restore the Speedster normalization mapping to include `additionalMetrics` with consistent keys, e.g.:

  * `additionalMetrics: { fcp, ttfb, speedIndex, tbt, ... }`
* Ensure values are in correct units (ms vs s) and consistent formatting.

Step 4 — Add an Explicit “Missing Data” Empty State (So We Know When Worker Needs Updates)
If Additional Metrics are missing from both live payload and snapshot:

* Render a visible panel (not an empty grid) saying:

  * “Additional Metrics unavailable (missing from worker response).”
  * “Missing fields: fcp, ttfb, speedIndex, tbt …”
* Provide a small “Run Vitals Scan” CTA (uses existing scan action) in case the worker only returns these after a full run.

Important:

* This message should only appear in Additional Metrics tab.
* It should not break the rest of the dashboard.

Step 5 — Verification Checklist

* When the API includes additional metrics:

  * The Additional Metrics tab shows real values
  * No “missing data” message is shown
* When the API omits them:

  * The tab clearly says the metrics are missing and lists the missing keys
  * The rest of the dashboard still works
* Refresh / Run Vitals Scan updates the Additional Metrics tab if the worker returns them after the run

Deliverable
A PR that:

* Restores Additional Metrics data rendering (mapping + UI)
* Adds a clear missing-data detector with explicit field list
* Uses snapshot fallback if live API fails, consistent with the rest of Speedster
