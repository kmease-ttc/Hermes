Objective
Remove the **Action Queue** from the home page because it is duplicative of **Missions**. Missions already represent the same underlying actions, and “Missions” is the preferred, cooler abstraction. The home page should not show both.

What’s Wrong

* “Action Queue” and “Missions” are effectively the same concept:

  * Both show pending actions
  * Both show what needs to be done next
* Having both creates redundancy and cognitive overload.
* Missions already exist as a first-class concept across crew dashboards and Mission Control.

Required End State

* The home page should NOT render an “Action Queue” section.
* Missions should be the single source of truth for actionable work.
* Users should discover and manage work via:

  * Mission Control
  * Individual crew dashboards (Missions section)

Implementation Instructions

1. Remove the Action Queue component from the home/dashboard page:

   * Identify the component rendering “Action Queue” on the home page.
   * Remove it entirely (do not hide with CSS).
   * Remove any data fetching or hooks used exclusively for Action Queue on the home page.

2. Ensure no orphaned logic remains:

   * If Action Queue data is still used elsewhere (e.g., Mission Control), leave it intact there.
   * If the home page was triggering any background fetches for Action Queue, remove those calls.

3. Optional (Nice-to-have, not required):

   * If there’s empty space after removal, let the page breathe—do not immediately replace it with another widget.
   * The home page should feel lighter and more focused on:

     * Crew summaries
     * High-level status
     * Entry points into Missions

What NOT to Do

* Do not rename Action Queue to Missions on the home page.
* Do not keep a collapsed or minimized version.
* Do not introduce another list of actions on the home page.

Acceptance Criteria

* The home page no longer shows “Action Queue.”
* All actionable work is accessed via Missions (Mission Control or crew pages).
* No duplicate action lists exist on the home page.
* The app still functions correctly with no missing data or errors.

This change intentionally simplifies the mental model: **Missions are the work.**
