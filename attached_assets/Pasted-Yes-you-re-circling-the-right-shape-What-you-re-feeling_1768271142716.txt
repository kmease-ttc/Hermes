Yes — you’re circling the right shape. What you’re feeling is the tension between power and effortlessness, and the page needs to resolve that instantly.

I’ll break this into four parts:

What the first-time landing experience must do

How to design the workflow choices without confusion

How to reconcile (not kill) the crew model

What Mission Control should actually communicate

1. First-time landing: this is not a dashboard, it’s an activation screen

Right now, you’re landing people in observation mode. That’s wrong for a first visit.

The first time someone lands here, the system should feel unfinished on purpose.

Mental model:

“Nothing works until you turn it on.”

The first-time state should have exactly one job:

Get the site into an operational mode.

That means the page should immediately ask for setup, not show metrics.

Required setup gates (in this order)

These are not optional, and they should block everything else visually:

Connect / Install

Install WordPress plugin or

Move hosting to Arclo or

Read-only scan (temporary, limited)

Pick automation mode (language matters, more on that below)

Confirm ownership + permissions

Only after these are complete does anything meaningful appear.

Until then, metrics should be blurred, locked, or replaced with placeholders like:

“Waiting for installation to begin monitoring.”

This creates urgency and clarity.

2. The three workflow paths (rename them, simplify them)

You already identified the right three paths — the problem is how they’re framed.

Do not present them as features. Present them as operating styles.

Replace this:

Export fix-it pack

Download plugin

Move hosting

With this mental framing:
Option A — “Handle It For Me”

(Fully automated)

Copy idea:

“Arclo monitors, fixes, and improves your site automatically.
You get notified only when something needs approval.”

Button:
Enable Automatic Mode

What it actually does:

Safe fixes auto-apply

Risky changes queue for approval

No instructions, no tickets
