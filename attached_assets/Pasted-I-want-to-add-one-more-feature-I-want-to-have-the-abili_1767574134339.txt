I want to add one more feature. I want to have the ability to export a report. I'll provide the sample report to you in one second. And the email went along with it. And I want to be able to basically generate something similar that people can use for themselves. Or if an agency buys the product, they could send this to a client. I guess when you'd, I'll send it. We need to package this up somehow. Hey Khan,

Thanks again for the feedback on what you actually want to be known for. That clarification makes the SEO strategy much cleaner—and more effective—because we can stop trying to make the site rank for “everything,” and instead make Google (and patients) immediately understand the two things you want to lead with:


Luxury health + longevity membership (the primary offer)

A small set of high-differentiation procedures (especially young plasma exchange)

I’m attaching two documents:


Technical SEO recommendations (what to fix sitewide so rankings can scale reliably)

Keyword ranking plan (a targeted plan for each of your priority keywords)

Below is the executive summary so you can see what’s going on and why the plan is sequenced the way it is.


What the data is telling us (overall story)

AustinRegen already demonstrates it can win in organic search for high-intent terms, and the current rankings for your target set are a strong proof point—especially around plasma-related searches. This matters because it means we’re not starting from scratch or trying to “manufacture” authority. Google already views the site as credible enough to rank in meaningful places.

The bigger issue is focus and clarity:


The site offers a lot of services, and that breadth creates patient confusion and diluted SEO signals.

When Google sees many overlapping pages with unclear hierarchy, mixed technical signals, and inconsistent internal linking, it becomes harder for the algorithm to confidently rank the right page for the right query—especially in competitive categories like peptides and sexual wellness.

The plan fixes that by (a) removing technical drag, and (b) creating a clean “one intent → one page” structure around your priority terms.


Technical SEO (why we’re starting here)

Before we push hard on new rankings, we want the site to be technically “quiet” and consistent so Google has clear crawl and indexing signals. The technical audit findings we discussed (broken internal links, indexation/canonical inconsistencies, page weight from images, heading/title structure inconsistencies, and missing best-practice security headers) aren’t catastrophic individually—but in aggregate they create friction that suppresses growth at scale.

That’s why the technical plan is sequenced to:


Stop crawl equity leakage (broken links / 4xx)

Confirm intentional indexation (noindex/canonicals applied only where intended)

Improve performance (image/page weight)

Standardize on-page structure (titles/headings so intent is unambiguous)

Implement baseline security headers (trust/risk reduction)

The outcome of this phase is simple: the site becomes consistently crawlable, cleanly indexable, faster, and easier for Google to interpret. That’s what allows the ranking plan to compound rather than stall out.


Keyword ranking plan (how we win for your targets)

The ranking plan is built around your updated targets:


longevity

peptide (peptide therapy)

regenerative medicine

plasma exchange

plasmapheresis

P-shot

young plasma exchange

luxury health

longevity membership program

The approach is not “write more content.” It’s structural and strategic:


Defend leadership where you’re already dominant (young plasma exchange)

Consolidate and clarify intent where terms overlap (plasma exchange vs plasmapheresis)

Compete where it’s realistic and high value (peptide therapy, P-shot) using credibility + page structure rather than hype

Avoid wasting effort on un-winnable generic national terms (e.g., “longevity” without local/program intent), and instead target local, high-intent variants that convert

Each keyword gets its own action plan: which page should own it, what that page needs structurally (titles/H1/H2/FAQs), and how internal linking should reinforce it—so rankings are deliberate and predictable rather than accidental.

Recommended rollout sequence


Phase 1 (Technical foundation): Fix crawl/indexation/performance/structure issues so the site is consistently “rank-eligible.”

Phase 2 (Ranking execution): Harden top performers (young plasma exchange, plasmapheresis) and build/upgrade the key pages for peptides, P-shot, longevity membership and regenerative medicine hub structure.

Phase 3 (Compounding growth): Expand supporting content only where it improves conversion and reinforces topical authority (not trying to outrank national publishers head-on).

If you’d like, once you’ve reviewed the attachments, the next step would be a short working session to confirm:


Which pages should be the primary “money pages” (membership + priority procedures)

Which services should be deemphasized or moved into secondary navigation

Any compliance constraints for the clinical trial language (so we stay accurate and safe)

From there, this becomes very executable: a technical punch list for whoever manages the site, plus a page-by-page SEO plan aligned to your business focus.
