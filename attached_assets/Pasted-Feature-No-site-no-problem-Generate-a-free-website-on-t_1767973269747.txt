Feature: “No site, no problem” — Generate a free website on the fly (secondary path)

Goal
Keep the primary funnel focused on “Enter your website → Get Free SEO Action Plan,” while adding a small, tasteful secondary path for users who don’t have a website. That secondary path should take them to a dedicated page where Hermes can generate a simple, branded website in minutes.

Information Architecture

1. Add a new top-level route/page:

* /create-site
* Nav label (optional): “Create a Site”
* If added to top nav, keep it visually de-emphasized (smaller, lighter, or in a “More” dropdown). Prefer link placement under the hero first.

2. Add a small secondary link under the homepage primary CTA:
   Placement (recommended):
   Directly under the trust microcopy (“No credit card…”) or under the form row, centered.

Copy option A (cleanest):
No site? No problem. Create a free site →

Copy option B (more explicit):
Don’t have a website yet? Create one free →

Styling:

* text-slate-600 (or 500)
* hover uses brand gradient or violet/pink (but subtle)
* underline on hover only
* do not turn it into a button

Homepage Acceptance Criteria

* The primary CTA remains dominant.
* The “No site?” link is discoverable but secondary (users see it if they need it, otherwise it disappears visually).

Create Site Page (/create-site) — UX Spec

Hero
Headline:
Create a website in minutes — free.

Subhead (one sentence):
Answer a few questions and Hermes will generate a fast, SEO-ready site you can publish instantly.

Form (single column, step-based or one page)
Minimum required fields:

* Business name
* Business type/category (dropdown)
* City/State (for local SEO)
* Phone (optional)
* Email (required)
* One-line description (optional)
* Primary service(s) (multi-select or comma-separated)
* Brand preference (optional): “Modern / Warm / Minimal”
* Domain preference:

  * Option 1: Use free subdomain (default)
  * Option 2: Connect my domain (later step)

Optional enhancements (nice-to-have, not required for v1):

* Logo upload (or auto-generate from business initials)
* Select 3 “vibes” (e.g., “clean,” “friendly,” “premium”)

Generate Flow

1. User submits form
2. Show a progress state with 3 steps:

* Creating your pages
* Writing SEO copy
* Publishing your site

3. Success state:

* Preview site
* Edit basics (name, phone, hero tagline)
* Publish now
* Get SEO Action Plan for my new site (bridges back to core funnel)

Site Output (v1)
Generate a small site with 3–5 pages:

* Home
* Services
* About
* Contact
* (Optional) Reviews or FAQ

Include:

* Mobile-first design
* Fast performance
* Basic schema (LocalBusiness)
* Metadata and social tags
* A clear primary CTA on site (Call / Contact / Book)

Backend / Technical Implementation (Pragmatic v1)

Data Model

* sites table:

  * id
  * user_id (nullable if you allow anonymous generation, but recommend email capture)
  * business_name, category, location, phone, email, description
  * theme_id
  * status (draft/generating/published)
  * published_url
  * created_at, updated_at

Site Generator Service

* POST /api/sites/generate

  * Input: business info
  * Output: jobId + initial draft site object
* GET /api/sites/status/:jobId

  * Returns progress + preview URL when ready

Generation approach (choose one)
Option A (fastest):

* Template-based static site generation
* Fill content blocks with LLM-generated copy
* Deploy to your existing deployer service (you already have “site-change-executor” style workers)

Option B (more flexible):

* Store site in DB as JSON blocks
* Render with your app as a hosted site
* Later export to static if needed

Domain/Hosting

* Default: free subdomain (e.g., businessname.hermes.site or generated slug)
* Add “Connect your domain” as a post-publish upsell or follow-up step

Analytics/Tracking

* Auto-add basic analytics snippet (optional)
* Capture conversion events:

  * started_create_site
  * generated_site_success
  * published_site_success
  * clicked_seo_action_plan_from_site_builder

Microcopy for Homepage Link
Use this exact line under the main CTA:
No site? No problem. Create a free site →

Microcopy for Create Site page reassurance

* “No design skills required”
* “Publish in minutes”
* “SEO-ready out of the box”
* “Free subdomain included”

Success Metrics

* % of homepage visitors who click “No site? No problem”
* % who complete generation
* % who publish
* % who run the SEO Action Plan after publishing

Implementation Checklist

1. Add /create-site route + nav entry (optional)
2. Add the small “No site? No problem” link under homepage CTA
3. Build create-site page UI + form validation
4. Add generate endpoint + job status endpoint
5. Implement template-based site generator and publish workflow
6. Build preview + publish success screen
7. Add event tracking

Definition of Done

* A user without a website can create and publish a basic site in one flow
* The homepage primary funnel remains focused on scanning an existing website
* The “No site? No problem” path is present but visually secondary
