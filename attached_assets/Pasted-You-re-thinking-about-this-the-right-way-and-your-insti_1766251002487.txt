You’re thinking about this the *right* way, and your instincts already line up with how the best internal SEO teams actually work. The key shift is this:

Stop thinking “health score dashboard.”
Start thinking **“SEO operating console per site.”**

Below is a best-practice setup that matches how *you* already work (Screaming Frog + GSC + SERP checks), but turns it into a clean, scalable product.

---

## Core principle (this matters most)

**One site at a time. One clear story. One clear next action.**

You do *not* want:

* A giant cross-site overview
* A single blended health score that hides tradeoffs
* A dashboard that answers “how are we doing?” but not “what do I do next?”

You *do* want:

* A site selector
* A structured diagnostic view
* A system that naturally leads into: *“Here’s the plan → ship the fixes”*

---

## High-level dashboard structure (best practice)

### 1. Site Selector (entry point)

Think like Search Console, not like an agency tool.

* Dropdown or left-rail list of sites
* Each site shows **status badges**, not full metrics:

  * Traffic: Up / Flat / Down
  * Technical: Clean / Warnings / Errors
  * Rankings: Improving / Stagnant / Dropping

This lets you quickly choose *where* to focus without noise.

Once a site is selected, everything below is **site-scoped**.

---

## Site Overview (the “CEO slide” for that site)

This is *not* where you do work.
This is where you orient yourself.

### Top summary (3 pillars, no blending)

Instead of one health score, use **three independent pillars**:

1. **Website Traffic**
2. **Technical SEO**
3. **Keyword & SERP Performance**

Each pillar should show:

* Status (Good / Needs Attention / Critical)
* One sentence explanation
* A “View details” action

Example:

* Website Traffic: ↓ Needs Attention
  *Organic sessions down 18% QoQ; paid stable*
* Technical SEO: ⚠ Needs Attention
  *Indexation issues and duplicate titles detected*
* Keyword Rankings: ↑ Improving
  *7 keywords moved into top 10*

This mirrors how *you* already think.

---

## Pillar 1: Website Traffic (GA4 + intent view)

This answers: **“Are people actually coming, and are they the right people?”**

Best-practice sections:

### A. Traffic trends (simple, directional)

* Organic traffic trend (30 / 90 days)
* Paid traffic trend
* Branded vs non-branded split (critical)

Don’t over-graph. One clean line per channel.

### B. Page-level impact

* Top landing pages by organic sessions
* Pages losing traffic fastest
* Pages gaining traffic fastest

This replaces manual GA4 digging.

### C. Conversion sanity check

* Are key events firing?
* Any sudden drop in conversions tied to traffic loss?

You don’t need funnel porn here—just red flags.

---

## Pillar 2: Technical SEO (your Screaming Frog brain, automated)

This is where most tools fail because they dump raw crawl data.

Best practice: **group by impact, not issue type.**

### A. Indexation & crawlability (highest priority)

* Pages blocked / noindexed incorrectly
* Canonical conflicts
* Orphaned pages
* Sitemap vs indexed mismatch

If Google can’t see it, nothing else matters.

### B. On-page hygiene

* Missing / duplicate titles
* Missing H1s
* Thin content flags
* Over-optimized titles

This should feel like a *curated Screaming Frog summary*, not a raw export.

### C. Performance & UX (lightweight)

* Core Web Vitals status
* Mobile vs desktop issues
* JS/rendering warnings (only if material)

No need to recreate PageSpeed Insights—just surface blockers.

---

## Pillar 3: Keyword & SERP Performance (Search Console + SERP API)

This answers: **“Are we winning the queries we care about?”**

### A. Keyword groups (this is important)

Instead of one giant list:

* Group keywords by intent or topic

  * Primary money terms
  * Supporting content terms
  * Branded terms

This mirrors how you manually think about ranking priorities.

### B. Movement, not position obsession

For each group:

* Winners (↑ positions)
* Losers (↓ positions)
* Stuck (positions 4–12 = opportunity gold)

Position 7 → 4 matters more than 40 → 30.

### C. Page ↔ keyword mapping

* Which URLs are ranking for which keywords
* Cannibalization flags
* Keywords with impressions but low CTR (title/meta work)

This is where action comes from.

---

## The most important screen: “Recommended Actions”

This is where your tool becomes **better than Screaming Frog + GSC combined**.

### Action model (best practice)

Every recommendation should have:

* What’s wrong
* Why it matters
* Expected impact (Traffic / Rankings / Stability)
* Effort level (Low / Medium / High)
* Action type:

  * Content update
  * Metadata update
  * Technical fix
  * Internal linking
  * New page needed

Example:

> Fix duplicate title tags on 14 service pages
> Impact: Improves CTR and avoids keyword cannibalization
> Effort: Low
> Suggested fix ready

---

## Pushing changes directly to the site (this is the unlock)

Best practice is **guardrails + preview**, not blind writes.

### Flow that works:

1. Diagnostic identifies issues
2. AI generates:

   * Updated titles/meta
   * Content edits
   * Internal links
3. You review in a diff-style preview
4. You approve:

   * Single change
   * Batch changes
5. System deploys via:

   * CMS API
   * Repo PR
   * Or patch endpoint

This matches how modern SEO teams work at scale.

---

## How this supports “asking questions”

Once structured like this, the questions become natural:

* “Why did traffic drop but rankings improve?”
* “Which fixes will move the needle fastest?”
* “What should I do this week vs this month?”
* “If I only fix 3 things, what are they?”

The dashboard becomes **context**, not the product.
The *conversation* becomes the product.

---

## TL;DR (design guidance you can hand to a dev)

* Don’t use one health score
* Use 3 independent pillars
* Always scope to one site at a time
* Group issues by impact, not by tool output
* End every diagnostic with deployable actions
* Make pushing changes a first-class feature, not an export

If you want, next step I can:

* Turn this into a wireframe layout (page by page), or
* Write dev instructions for building this exact dashboard flow, or
* Design the “Recommended Actions → Push to Site” workflow in detail
