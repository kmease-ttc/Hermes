Objective
Enhance the SERP Tracking “All Keywords” table so each keyword includes:

* Search Volume (monthly volume)
* Difficulty (how hard it is to rank)
* Priority (how likely it is to drive leads for this business)

The goal is to make the keyword list actionable for lead growth, not just rankings.

UI Changes (All Keywords Table)

1. Add 3 new columns to the All Keywords table:

* Volume (Monthly)
* Difficulty
* Priority

2. Column behavior

* Volume: numeric monthly search volume (e.g., 40, 210, 1,900). Show “—” if unknown.
* Difficulty: 0–100 score (or Low/Med/High if that’s all we have). Show “—” if unknown.
* Priority: 1–5 (or High/Med/Low), where Priority reflects lead-driving potential. Must not be the same as difficulty.

3. Sorting & filtering

* Add sort support for Volume, Difficulty, Priority
* Default sort option: Priority desc, then Volume desc
* Add quick filters:

  * Priority: High/Med/Low (or 1–5)
  * Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard (mapped from score thresholds)
  * Volume ranges (optional)

Data Model / Persistence (Required)
Update the target keywords source-of-truth to store these fields (per domain, per keyword):

* keyword
* volume_monthly (int, nullable)
* difficulty (int 0–100, nullable)
* priority (int 1–5 or enum, required once computed)
* priority_reason (text, optional; short explanation)
* intent (optional: transactional / informational / local)
* updated_at

IMPORTANT: These values must be stored and not recomputed on every page load.

How to Populate Volume + Difficulty
Use one of these approaches (implement the best available based on current integrations):
A) If SERP worker already returns volume/difficulty:

* Parse it and persist into the keyword records.
* Backfill existing keywords on next refresh.

B) If SERP worker does NOT return volume/difficulty:

* Add a keyword enrichment step:

  * Create endpoint: POST /api/keywords/enrich
  * For each keyword missing volume/difficulty, call an external provider (if configured) OR store as null and proceed.
  * Persist results.

Do not block the UI on this enrichment. It should run async-ish via a “Enrich Keywords” button or run during Full Check and update when complete.

How to Compute “Priority” (Lead Impact)
Priority is NOT difficulty and NOT volume alone. It is “expected lead value.”
Compute Priority using an AI scoring step (since you have ChatGPT integrated) plus simple heuristics.

Create endpoint: POST /api/keywords/score-priority
Inputs:

* domain
* business type: Psychiatry clinic
* location: Orlando (or configured location)
* list of keywords with volume + difficulty (if present)
  Outputs per keyword:
* priority (1–5)
* short reason (1 sentence)
* optional intent tag: “high-intent / informational / brand / insurance / urgent / medication management”

Scoring guidance (rules)

* Highest priority keywords are those with strong purchase/appointment intent:

  * “psychiatrist orlando”, “telepsychiatry orlando”, “same day psychiatrist orlando”, “psychiatrist near me”, “anxiety psychiatrist orlando”, “depression psychiatrist orlando”
* Penalize low-conversion informational queries unless they are part of a content strategy.
* Prefer local + service keywords over generic mental health terms.
* Consider volume, but do not over-prioritize volume if intent is weak.
* Difficulty should influence priority only as a secondary “effort” signal (e.g., high intent but very hard can still be high priority, just flagged).

Display Requirements

* Priority should render as:

  * A small badge (High/Med/Low) or 1–5 dots
  * Tooltip showing “reason” on hover
* Difficulty should render as:

  * Score + subtle label (Easy/Med/Hard)
* Volume should render as:

  * formatted number with commas

Workflow Integration

* On “Generate my target keywords”:

  1. Generate keywords
  2. Enrich volume/difficulty (if possible)
  3. Score priority
  4. Save all fields
  5. Run SERP check

* On “Full Check”:

  * Refresh SERP positions (respect 7-day rule unless force)
  * Enrich missing volume/difficulty
  * Re-score priority if new keywords were added or if volume/difficulty changed

Acceptance Criteria

* All Keywords table shows Volume, Difficulty, Priority for each row (or “—” if unavailable)
* Priority is visibly actionable and aligns with “drives most leads”
* User can sort by Priority and quickly see the lead-focused targets first
* Data persists; reload does not lose values
