Change crew “Score” semantics: the number shown as the crew score should be the TOTAL number of missions that need to be accomplished for that crew (for the selected site + time window). Remove/replace the current 0–100 “health score” everywhere it appears.

New definition (source of truth)
Crew Score (displayed number) = count of missions in a “needs attention / pending” state for that crew.

* If a crew has 0 pending missions → score shows 0 and status pill shows “All clear”
* If a crew has 5 pending missions → score shows 5 and status pill shows “Needs attention”

Important: This is not “completed this week” and not a weighted health score.

Where this should show

* Dashboard Crew Summary cards (the number in the top right of each crew card)
* Crew page header score pill
* Missions widget circle on crew page (if present)
  All must show the same number because they all read from the same mission summary.

Computation rules
Given missions for {siteId, crewId}:

* pending = missions.filter(m => m.status in ["pending","blocked","needs_setup","error"]).length
* optional: exclude “completed” and “dismissed”
* optional: include “blocked” because it still requires action

Windowing:

* Default to “current mission set” (not a rolling 7/30 day KPI window)
* If mission generation is time-bound, define “active” missions as those with active=true or created within last N days.

API changes (single source)

1. Ensure missions endpoint returns a per-crew summary:
   GET /api/sites/:siteId/missions/summary
   returns:
   {
   siteId,
   crews: [
   { crewId: "popular", pending: 1, total: 3, completedThisWeek: 0 },
   { crewId: "lookout", pending: 4, total: 6, completedThisWeek: 1 },
   ...
   ],
   overall: { pending: X, total: Y }
   }

2. Update crew status endpoint (or replace score field)
   GET /api/sites/:siteId/crew-status
   returns for each crew:
   {
   crewId,
   score: pending,              // score now equals pending missions
   missions: { pending, total, completedThisWeek },
   status: pending === 0 ? "ok" : "needs_attention",
   actions: pending > 0 ? [...] : [...]
   }

Client changes

* Replace any UI label “Score” with “Missions” (or “Open missions”) to avoid confusion.
* The pill in the crew header should read:

  * “Missions: 1” (or just “1” with a tooltip “Open missions”)
* Dashboard crew cards should display the same pending mission count.

Consistency rule

* The number shown on:

  * dashboard crew card
  * crew page header pill
  * missions widget badge
    must come from the same field: missions.pending (or missions.total if you prefer total).

Clarify: pending vs total
You said “total number of missions you need to accomplish.”
That maps best to “pending” (because completed missions are not needed anymore).
If you truly want “total generated missions regardless of completion,” then use missions.total instead.
Recommended: use pending as the displayed number, but show “pending/total” in the missions section (e.g., “1 of 5”).

Acceptance criteria

* Popular shows “1” on its header (matches “1 missions” in the Missions panel).
* Lookout shows the same number on dashboard and on Lookout page.
* No crew shows 31/58/98 unless that is literally the count of open missions.
* Score mismatches are impossible because there’s only one mission summary feeding the UI.

Deliverable

* One PR that:

  1. updates the CrewStatus model to use missions.pending (or missions.total) as score
  2. updates dashboard + crew pages to render mission count instead of health score
  3. updates labeling/tooltips to reflect “Open missions”
  4. adds a small test: crew page score equals missions.pending from API
