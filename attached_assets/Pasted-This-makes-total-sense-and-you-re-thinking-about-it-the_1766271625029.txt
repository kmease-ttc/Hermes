This makes total sense, and you’re thinking about it the *right* way. What you want is not “settings,” it’s **operational visibility**.

Below is a clean, opinionated way to do this that scales with your architecture and matches how SEO Doctor actually works.

---

## Rename the Concept: **Integrations**, not Settings

**Settings** implies configuration.
What you want is **truth + health + contracts**.

Create a **top-level “Integrations” section** in the app (sidebar or main nav), separate from Settings.

Think of this as the **control plane for everything SEO Doctor can talk to**.

---

## Integration Section — Core Goals

The Integrations section should answer, at a glance:

1. **What services exist**
2. **Which ones are connected**
3. **Whether they are healthy**
4. **What SEO Doctor is actually receiving from them**
5. **Whether those signals are recent, valid, and usable**

Not just “configured” — **proven working**.

## Integration Page Structure (Recommended)

### 1. Integrations Overview (Table / Cards)

Each service appears as a row or card.

**Columns / Fields:**

* Service Name
* Category (Data / Analysis / Execution / Infrastructure)
* Status (Healthy / Degraded / Disconnected)
* Last Successful Call
* Website Coverage (which `website_id`s it’s active for)
* Required Signals (✓ / ✕)
* Actions

Example:

| Service               | Status          | Last Run | Required Data    | Actions |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Google Data Connector | 🟢 Healthy      | 2h ago   | GSC ✓ GA4 ✓      | View    |
| Crawl & Render        | 🟡 Partial      | 1d ago   | Crawl ✓ Render ✕ | Fix     |
| SERP & Keyword Intel  | 🟢 Healthy      | 6h ago   | Ranks ✓ SERP ✓   | View    |
| Backlink Signals      | 🔴 Disconnected | —        | Authority ✕      | Connect |

---

### 2. Service Detail Page (Critical)

Clicking a service opens a **Service Health & Contract view**.

This is the most important part.

#### A. Connection Status

* API key / OAuth status
* Token expiration (if applicable)
* Vault source (Bitwarden ✓)
* Environment (Prod / Dev)

#### B. Expected Contract (Very Important)

Explicitly list:

> “What SEO Doctor expects from this service”

Example for **Google Data Connector**:

* impressions (daily)
* clicks (daily)
* CTR
* avg position
* top queries
* top pages
* sessions
* users
* landing pages

Each item shows:

* ✅ Received
* ⚠️ Received but stale
* ❌ Missing

This makes gaps immediately obvious.

---

#### C. Live Signal Preview (Read-only)

Show **actual sample payloads** (trimmed):

* Last GSC query response
* Last GA4 response
* Timestamp
* Row count

This answers:

> “Is the data real and useful?”

---

#### D. Recent Activity Log

Pulled from Observability:

* Last 10 calls
* Duration
* Success / failure
* Error messages (if any)

---

#### E. “Test Integration” Button

This is huge.

Each integration must support:

* **Test Connection**
* **Fetch Sample Data**
* **Validate Contract**

Results shown inline, not in logs.

---

## How This Ties Back to AI Doctor Core

AI Doctor should **depend on Integrations being healthy**, but not hide failures.

Examples:

* If Content Decay Monitor is missing → show diagnosis with reduced confidence
* If Backlink service is disconnected → explicitly state “Authority signals unavailable”
* If Crawl render checks fail → flag JS visibility risk

This turns integrations into **explainable dependencies**, not magic pipes.

---

## Where Settings Still Live

Keep **Settings** boring and minimal:

* Website config
* Run frequency
* Safe mode
* Notifications preferences

Anything that:

* Talks to another system
* Produces signals
* Can fail independently

→ lives under **Integrations**.

---

## Internal Data Model (High-Level)

You’ll want a simple table like:

**integrations**

* id
* name
* type
* enabled
* health_status
* last_success_at
* last_error
* contract_version

**integration_checks**

* integration_id
* website_id
* check_type (auth | data | freshness | completeness)
* status
* details
* checked_at

This makes everything observable and testable.

---

## Why This Is the Right Move

This gives you:

* Confidence before automation
* Trust in diagnoses
* Clear “what’s missing” explanations
* A foundation for ArcGlow Pro multi-tenant ops
* A UI that feels like a *real platform*, not a toy dashboard

If you want, next we can:

* Design the exact **Integrations UI layout**
* Define the **contract schema per service**
* Write the **integration test endpoint spec** every service must implement
* Or wire this directly into the Observability service you’re building

Just tell me which one you want to tackle next.
