Implement a clear, consistent distinction between Missions and Score across the entire app.

Definitions (canonical)

1. Missions

* What it means: the count of actionable items that are still left to do (open tasks).
* Display name: “Open Missions”
* Source: mission engine output (pending + blocked + needs_setup + error; excludes completed/dismissed).

2. Score

* What it means: a 0–100 rating for that category/crew that reflects performance/health/compliance.
* Display name: “Score”
* Source: crew scoring function (evidence-based from that crew’s KPIs/findings), not derived from mission count.

Data contract (single source of truth)
Every crew status object must include BOTH fields:
{
crewId,
score: { value: number|null, status: "ok"|"unknown", updatedAt, explanation?: string },
missions: { open: number, total?: number, completedThisWeek?: number }
}

UI rules (apply everywhere)
A) Any time you show a score

* Use a “Score” pill/badge (e.g., “Score 58”)
* Tooltip: “Score is a 0–100 rating for this category.”

B) Any time you show missions

* Always show the mission icon + count (MissionBadge)
* Label it “Open Missions” (or just show icon + count with tooltip)
* Tooltip: “Open missions are tasks you still need to complete.”

C) Never substitute one for the other

* No page should show mission count in the “Score” location.
* No page should show score inside the gold mission circle.

Where each value should appear

1. Dashboard crew cards

* Top-right: Score pill (0–100)
* Secondary: Mission icon + Open Missions count
* If open > 0: highlight the mission badge.

2. Crew page header

* Score pill next to crew name
* Mission badge next to score

3. Missions panel (crew page)

* Gold circle: Open Missions count for that crew
* Right side: “X missions” must match Open Missions

4. Mission Control

* Gold circle: total Open Missions across all crews (sum of missions.open for the selected site)
* List items: show crew theme + mission icon for each mission

Scoring behavior (make it explainable)

* Each crew must define a primary KPI and scoring formula (versioned).
* Add a small “Why this score?” link/tooltip that shows 1–2 bullets of the top drivers.
* If score can’t be computed yet (no data/integration), show “Score —” + CTA to configure the required integration.

No dead ends
If missions.open > 0 but score is unknown:

* Show missions normally
* Score shows “—” with CTA “Configure [owner integration]”
  If score exists but missions.open = 0:
* Show “0” missions and “All clear” state

Acceptance criteria

* For any crew and any page, Score and Open Missions are both visible and consistent:

  * The Score number matches everywhere (dashboard vs crew page).
  * The Open Missions count matches everywhere (dashboard badge vs crew missions panel).
* The gold circle always means missions (never score).
* Users can tell at a glance:

  * “How many things do I still need to do?” (missions)
  * “How am I doing overall?” (score)

Deliverable

* Update server/services/crewStatus.ts to return both score + missions.open consistently (no swapping).
* Add a shared <MissionBadge /> component and use it everywhere missions are displayed.
* Update all crew cards and headers to show Score + MissionBadge.
* Add one regression test that asserts score and missions.open are both present and not derived from each other.
