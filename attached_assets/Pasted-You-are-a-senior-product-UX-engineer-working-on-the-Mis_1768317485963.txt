You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **Mission Control dashboard**. The Accomplishments section exists, but it is currently **system-centric** (“analytics connected”) instead of **value-centric** (“more traffic, more leads, better rankings”). Your task is to refocus Accomplishments so it delivers **dopamine, proof of value, and ROI reinforcement**.

This is a **content model + presentation refactor**, not a new feature build.

---

## CORE PROBLEM TO FIX

Right now Accomplishments answer:

> “What did the system do?”

They must instead answer:

> **“What improved for my business?”**

If the user can’t immediately point to:

* more traffic
* more leads
* better rankings
* reduced risk

…then the section is not doing its job.

---

## NEW PURPOSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS (LOCK THIS IN)

**Accomplishments = Business Wins**

This section should:

* Reinforce that Arclo is working
* Make progress feel tangible
* Justify cost emotionally
* Encourage continued usage

Think:

> “This is already paying off.”

---

## CONTENT HIERARCHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each accomplishment must follow this structure:

1. **Primary line = outcome (business metric)**
2. **Secondary line = what Arclo did to cause it**
3. **Time context = when it happened**

Never lead with integrations or scans unless nothing else exists.

---

## ACCOMPLISHMENT TYPES (PRIORITY ORDER)

When generating the list, always prefer items in this order:

### 1) Revenue / Lead Impact (highest dopamine)

Examples:

* **+3 new leads detected**
  “Conversion tracking enabled and validated”
* **Form submissions increased**
  “Tracking verified across key pages”

Use even small numbers. Small wins still feel like wins.

---

### 2) Traffic & Visibility Gains

Examples:

* **Traffic stabilized on key pages**
  “Performance and indexing issues resolved”
* **Ranking improvements detected**
  “5 target keywords moved up in search results”
* **Search visibility increased**
  “New pages indexed and validated”

Avoid vague language. Use counts when possible.

---

### 3) Risk Reduction / Protection

Examples:

* **Indexing issues prevented**
  “12 pages confirmed indexed and error-free”
* **Performance regressions avoided**
  “Core Web Vitals monitored and updated”

This frames maintenance as value, not busywork.

---

### 4) System Setup (fallback only)

Only show when no business metrics exist yet.

Examples:

* **Analytics connected**
  “Now tracking traffic and conversions”
* **Monitoring enabled**
  “Future issues will be detected automatically”

These should appear lower in the list and feel like *enablers*, not achievements.

---

## DESIGN ADJUSTMENTS (IMPORTANT)

### Visual tone

* This section should feel:

  * Positive
  * Calm
  * Rewarding
* Reduce technical iconography.
* Prefer:

  * Up arrows
  * Checkmarks
  * Spark / trend icons

### Copy tone

* Avoid words like:

  * “completed”
  * “executed”
  * “collected”
* Prefer:

  * “increased”
  * “improved”
  * “detected”
  * “protected”
  * “unlocked”

---

## EXAMPLE: BEFORE vs AFTER

### ❌ Before

**Analytics connected**
GA4 and Search Console data successfully synced

### ✅ After

**Traffic and leads are now being tracked**
Conversion and traffic data validated across your site

---

### ❌ Before

**Performance scan completed**
Core Web Vitals data updated across key pages

### ✅ After

**Page performance issues identified early**
Core Web Vitals monitored across high-impact pages

---

## COUNT BADGE (VERY IMPORTANT)

The badge “3 improvements completed” should be reframed as:

* **“3 business improvements delivered”**
  or
* **“3 wins this week”**

This number should:

* Reset weekly (later)
* Feel like momentum, not history

---

## EMPTY / EARLY STATE (DON’T MISS THIS)

If no business wins are available yet:

Show:

> “Your first wins will appear here as Arclo starts improving traffic, leads, and rankings.”

Then show **ONE setup item** as a bridge:

* “Analytics enabled — traffic and leads will now be tracked”

---

## DATA SOURCING (KEEP IT SIMPLE)

Do NOT overengineer.

You can derive accomplishments from:

* Completed tasks with impact metadata
* Metric deltas (even coarse)
* Integration enablement as fallback

If exact deltas aren’t available:

* Use directional language (“improvements detected”, “issues prevented”)
* But ALWAYS tie it to business outcomes.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking done, verify:

* At least 2 of the visible accomplishments reference:

  * traffic
  * leads
  * rankings
  * visibility
* System-only items appear last or not at all
* The section feels rewarding, not technical
* A business owner can read this and say:

  > “Okay, this is doing something for me.”

If it doesn’t spark that reaction, rewrite the copy.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE (DO NOT IGNORE)

> **People don’t pay for tasks. They pay for progress.**

This section exists to emotionally justify the subscription.
Make it earn its place.

Implement this refactor before adding any new gamification or charts.
