You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **Mission Control dashboard**. The current UI has both a **Tasks** section and a **Recommended Actions** section that overlap conceptually. This creates cognitive friction.

Your task is to **collapse Tasks into Recommended Actions**, making Recommended Actions the **single source of truth** for “what to do next”.

This is a **UI consolidation + visual ownership refactor**, not a backend logic change.

---

## CORE DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

* ❌ Remove the standalone **Tasks** section entirely
* ✅ Keep **Recommended Actions** as the only action-driving section
* ✅ Recommended Actions becomes the place users look when they ask:

  > “What should I do next?”

No duplication. No parallel concepts.

---

## PART 1 — Remove / collapse Tasks

### What to remove

* Remove the entire **Tasks** container:

  * Header (“Tasks OK”)
  * “Next: Complete …” row
  * Task list rows
  * “Run Diagnostics” button inside Tasks

### What to keep

* All *content logic* (counts, next action, open count) should now feed into **Recommended Actions**

The **open count (21)** must still exist — but only in one place.

---

## PART 2 — Promote Recommended Actions into the primary action section

### Recommended Actions card becomes:

* The **single, authoritative action card**
* Gold/amber glow (attention)
* Clear hierarchy:

  * Header
  * Next Action (featured)
  * Secondary actions

### Header requirements

* Title: **Recommended Actions**
* Subtitle:
  “Complete these to improve traffic, rankings, and conversions.”
* Right side:

  * Open count badge (e.g. “21 open”)

---

## PART 3 — Agent ownership color (very important)

### Problem to solve

Right now, it’s unclear *who* is doing the work.

### Solution

The **circular badge / icon** inside the Recommended Actions card must use the **agent’s brand color**.

#### Implementation rules

* Each agent already has a canonical color (Scotty, Speedster, Lookout, etc.)
* Use that color for:

  * The small circular badge
  * The left-side agent indicator
* The **card border remains gold** (action)
* The **agent color lives inside the circle only**

This creates a clear mental model:

> Gold = action needed
> Color = who is doing the work

---

## PART 4 — Structure of the Recommended Actions card

### Featured Next Action (top, dominant)

Must include:

* Agent badge (colored circle, agent color)
* Agent name (small)
* Action title (large)
* Clear outcome-oriented description
* One primary CTA

Example:

**Protect Search Visibility**
“Verify which pages are indexed and detect hidden errors before rankings drop.”

Agent badge:

* Scotty (orange)

CTA:

* **Fix This Now** (green is acceptable *only* here because it’s execution)

---

### Secondary Actions (below, condensed)

* Same card container
* Smaller rows or mini-cards
* Each shows:

  * Agent badge (agent color)
  * Action title
  * One-line outcome
  * “Fix This →” secondary CTA

Do NOT repeat descriptions verbatim from the top action.

---

## PART 5 — Visual & interaction rules

* Recommended Actions must feel:

  * Bigger
  * More important
  * More intentional than Key Metrics
* This section should visually answer:

  > “If I only do one thing today, it’s this.”

---

## PART 6 — Count handling

* The open count (“21 open”) appears:

  * Once
  * In the Recommended Actions header
* Remove any other duplicated counts

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking done, verify:

* There is **no separate Tasks section**
* Recommended Actions is the only place for action items
* The card has a gold/amber glow
* The **agent badge uses the agent’s color**
* It is immediately obvious:

  * what the next action is
  * who will do the work
  * why it matters
* The page feels simpler and more decisive

If a user asks:

> “Where do I click to improve things?”

The answer should now be obvious.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **One section. One decision. One owner.**

Recommended Actions should feel like a confident recommendation, not a backlog.

Implement this consolidation and stop here — this is a strong, clean endpoint for the dashboard.
