HERMES CREW PAGE FIX — MUST MATCH SPEC

The current /crew page is wrong in 3 ways:
1) The ship is not implemented as compartments/rooms (it’s an oval with dashed boxes)
2) The left card contains “Add to ship” and recommended crew details (this must NOT be visible until a room is clicked)
3) Copy is wrong: do not say “Add to Ship” in the main left panel; only show enable/select inside the role drawer.

NON-NEGOTIABLE LAYOUT ABOVE THE FOLD
LEFT: a compact STATUS CARD with two tabs
  Tab 1: “Progress”
    - Progress ring (Operational %)
    - Roles staffed (e.g., 5/8)
    - Maturity badge (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Best-in-Class)
    - Optional: “Ahead of X%” (can be placeholder)
  Tab 2: “Next Up”
    - Show 2–3 “Lowest friction wins” or “Missing to unlock” items (not a crew member CTA)
    - Example: “Unlock Revenue Attribution: missing Lookout + Natasha”
RIGHT: SHIP CANVAS (hero element)

DO NOT render any “recommended crew member” detail or action button in the left panel.
DO NOT show any “Enable/Add to Ship” action on the left panel.

INTERACTION RULE
- Clicking a ship room opens a RIGHT-SIDE DRAWER (role drawer).
- Only inside the drawer do we show:
  - Role details
  - Enable/Disable buttons
  - Preview Select toggle (optional)

SHIP CANVAS MUST BE REAL COMPARTMENTS
Implement the ship as:
- A light ship body panel (rounded, subtle panel lines)
- Inside, “rooms” that are clearly distinct compartments (rectangular/squircle panels), not dashed empty boxes.
- Each room contains:
  - Role label
  - Avatar silhouette when empty (opacity 0.2)
  - If selected: opacity 0.55 + “Selected”
  - If enabled: opacity 1.0 + “Active” + subtle gold glow

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT (DO THIS IN CODE)
Create/replace these components and mount them:
- components/crew/ShipCanvas.tsx
- components/crew/StatusCard.tsx
- components/crew/RoleDrawer.tsx
- pages/crew.tsx (or app route)

The ship must be implemented using a fixed layout of compartments, using absolute positioning OR CSS grid with named areas.
Do NOT use dashed boxes as the final representation.

COPY RULES
- Replace “Add to Ship” with:
  - In drawer: “Enable” (dashboard) + “Select” (preview)
- “Enable” triggers backend enablement (stub ok)
- Left panel tabs are informational only

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Left panel has two tabs: Progress / Next Up
- No “Enable/Add to ship” button visible until a ship room is clicked
- Ship rooms look like compartments and feel like they “hold” a role
- Clicking a room opens role drawer and shows actions there
