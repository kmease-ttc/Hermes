You are a senior Content Quality + SEO engineer working in the Hermes SEO / Arclo codebase.

Goal
Fully implement **Hemingway (Content Quality & Readability)** so the page is complete, data-driven, and aligned with the global KPI style guide (same as Natasha, Lookout, Scotty, Sentinel).

Hemingway’s mission
“Ensure all content is clear, readable, credible, and aligned with search intent so it converts and sustains rankings.”

Hemingway is **not a writer**. He is a **quality gate**.

---

## Part A — KPI / Metrics section (top of page)

Use the **standard KPI components** and **Hemingway crew accent color**.

Hemingway KPIs must be:

1. **Content Quality Score**

* Definition: Weighted score combining readability, structure, clarity, and SEO hygiene.
* Source: content analysis worker.
* Value: 0–100
* Status:

  * Green ≥ 80
  * Gold 60–79
  * Red < 60

2. **Readability Grade**

* Definition: Average Flesch-Kincaid or equivalent grade across indexed pages.
* Value: numeric (e.g., 7.8)
* Status:

  * Green ≤ 8
  * Gold 9–11
  * Red > 11

3. **Pages Needing Improvement**

* Definition: Count of pages below quality threshold.
* Value: integer
* Status:

  * Green = 0–3
  * Gold = 4–10
  * Red > 10

4. **E-E-A-T Coverage**

* Definition: % of pages meeting E-E-A-T heuristics (author, credentials, citations, trust signals).
* Value: percent
* Status:

  * Green ≥ 80%
  * Gold 60–79%
  * Red < 60%

No blanks. No placeholders.

## Part B — Missions section

Hemingway missions should feel **editorial + diagnostic**, not generative.

Include:

1. **Analyze Content Quality**

* Action: runs quality analysis across all indexed pages.
* Output:

  * readability
  * structure
  * clarity
  * trust signals
  * intent alignment

2. **Identify Weak Pages**

* Action: surfaces pages below quality thresholds.
* Output: prioritized list by impact.

3. **Improve Content Quality**

* Action: queues improvements via content agents or deployer.
* Must support:

  * single-page fix
  * bulk fixes

---

## Part C — Findings tab (default)

This is Hemingway’s core.

Render a table of **Pages Needing Improvement**, grouped by severity:

Each row must include:

* URL
* Primary keyword
* Readability grade
* Quality score
* Issues detected (tags):

  * too complex
  * thin content
  * poor structure
  * weak E-E-A-T
* Recommended action
* **Fix** button (if deployable)

Severity:

* Critical
* Warning
* Minor

---

## Part D — Content Quality Breakdown tab

Show diagnostic visuals:

1. **Readability distribution**

* Histogram of grade levels.

2. **Quality score distribution**

* Bars or donut.

3. **Common issues**

* % of pages with:

  * long sentences
  * passive voice
  * missing headings
  * missing author info
  * missing citations

---

## Part E — Trends tab (quality over time)

Track and render:

* Avg quality score over time
* Avg readability grade over time
* Pages improved vs pages regressed
* E-E-A-T coverage over time

Use the same snapshot pattern as Natasha/Sentinel.

If no history:

* Empty state + “Run Hemingway analysis to start tracking.”

---

## Part F — Controls / Fixes

Fix buttons should:

* Queue quality improvements
* Show progress + completion
* Clearly label:

  * auto-fixable (structure, headings, clarity)
  * advisory (tone, expertise depth)

---

## Part G — Validation rules

* Hemingway KPIs must never be blank.
* Scores must be deterministic (same input = same score).
* Hemingway must not modify keywords or rankings directly.
* Fixes must flow through deployer / content agents, not inline edits.

---

## Acceptance criteria

* Hemingway page feels as complete and authoritative as Scotty and Sentinel.
* KPIs immediately communicate content quality health.
* Findings table is populated after one run.
* Trends provide real signal over time.
* Styling matches the global KPI standard with Hemingway crew colors.
