Replit Prompt: Apply the Bounce Rate “Glass Tint” Effect to Crew Summary Cards (Mission Control)

Goal
On Mission Control, the Bounce Rate key metric card has a really nice “tinted glass” treatment (subtle translucent fill + border/glow). I want that same effect applied to the Crew Summary cards — but each crew card should use its OWN crew accent color as the tint.

Scope

* Only the Crew Summary cards on Mission Control (Natasha, Lookout, Popular, Scotty, Speedster, Sentinel, etc.)
* Do not change layout, typography, or content — this is purely the background/border/glow treatment.

Design rules

* Use the same exact tint/glass styling recipe as the Bounce Rate card.
* Replace Bounce Rate’s red tint with the crew member’s accent tint:

  * Lookout → pink tint
  * Sentinel → blue tint
  * Speedster → green tint
  * Popular → teal/blue tint (whatever its current accent is)
  * Scotty → his accent (but keep it high-contrast)
  * Natasha → her new non-red accent (once updated)
* Keep semantic red for negative deltas only (e.g., -12%, -50%) — do not recolor those.
* The rest of the card stays cold glass; this just adds a subtle tinted layer for contrast.

Implementation approach

1. Extract the Bounce Rate tint treatment into a reusable Card variant

* Locate the Key Metric card component and identify the Bounce Rate-specific classes that create the tinted glass.
* Create a reusable variant for Card:

  * variant="tintedGlass"
  * props: tintColor (or tintRgb via CSS variables)

2. Apply tintedGlass to Crew Summary cards

* In the Crew Summary card component:

  * determine crewAccentColor from the centralized crew color map
  * set tintColor to that accent
  * apply the same border/glow intensity as Bounce Rate (not stronger)

3. Ensure consistency + avoid artifacts

* The tint should be subtle (10–18% opacity) so it doesn’t overpower content.
* Keep borders smooth and consistent across all cards.
* No hardcoded Tailwind palette colors (use tokens/CSS vars).

Acceptance criteria

* Crew Summary cards visually “pop” like the Bounce Rate card, but each card is tinted by the crew member’s color.
* The effect is uniform and consistent (same opacity/glow recipe).
* Negative deltas remain red and readable.
* No layout changes and no new random colors.

Deliverable

* Reusable tintedGlass card variant
* Crew Summary cards updated to use tintedGlass + crew tint
