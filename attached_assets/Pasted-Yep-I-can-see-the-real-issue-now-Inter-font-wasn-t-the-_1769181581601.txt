Yep — I can see the real issue now. Inter/font wasn’t the main problem.

What’s actually wrong (and why it looks “washed out”)

Your UI is applying opacity to text color variables. The agent even surfaced it:

rgba(248, 250, 252, 0.94) — that alpha makes text look faded
…and in your dashboard, a bunch of labels look like they’re at ~40–60% opacity, not true contrast.

This is almost always caused by one of these patterns:
	1.	CSS variables like:

--foreground: 248 250 252 / 0.94;

	2.	Tailwind classes like:

	•	text-white/60
	•	text-slate-400
	•	opacity-60 on a parent container

	3.	“muted” token usage on primary text by mistake (e.g. using muted-foreground everywhere)

Fix it the right way (one pass)

Step 1 — Make primary text 100% opacity

Wherever your tokens are defined (likely src/index.css or src/styles/theme.css), change your foreground/text tokens to no alpha.

If you have something like:

--foreground: 248 250 252 / 0.94;

Change to:

--foreground: 248 250 252;

Or if you’re using hex:
	•	Primary text should be solid:
	•	#0F172A (slate-900) on light backgrounds
	•	#FFFFFF on dark nav

No opacity for primary text.

Step 2 — Split “primary text” vs “muted text”

You need two separate tokens, and you must use them consistently:
	•	Primary text: always solid
	•	text-text-primary → #0F172A
	•	Secondary text: slightly muted but still readable
	•	text-text-secondary → #475569

Avoid using alpha here too; just use the lighter neutral.

Step 3 — Remove opacity from containers

Search your repo for:
	•	opacity-
	•	text-white/
	•	text-slate- (especially 300–500)
	•	text-gray- (especially 300–500)

Specifically check:
	•	Dashboard cards
	•	Subheaders
	•	Stat labels (“Traffic at risk/mo”, “Updated weekly…”)

If any parent wrapper has opacity-50 or similar, remove it. That fades everything inside.

⸻

Sidebar should be purple (you mentioned this too)

Your sidebar is still too close to black. That’s because your nav token is using a very dark violet.

Set the nav surface to a real brand-purple surface, not near-black.

Recommended:
	•	surface.nav = #4C1D95 is fine for contrast, but if it’s too dark, move it up to:
	•	#5B21B6 (violet-800-ish)

Then ensure nav text is:
	•	#FFFFFF (solid)
	•	inactive text can be #FFFFFF with opacity like /80 (that’s acceptable on dark backgrounds)

⸻

Quick confirmation test (takes 15 seconds)

After the token fix:
	•	The dashboard title and labels should look crisp
	•	The “Updated weekly…” line should be readable, not ghosted
	•	Card labels shouldn’t disappear into the background

If you want the fastest path right now

Tell me which file contains your token variables:
	•	src/index.css
	•	src/styles/*
	•	src/theme/*

Or paste the section where --foreground / --text-* is defined.

I’ll tell you the exact 3–5 lines to change so the whole app snaps into proper contrast.
