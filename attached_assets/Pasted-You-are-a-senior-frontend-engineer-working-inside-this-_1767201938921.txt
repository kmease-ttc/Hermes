Goal
Visually upgrade the **Key Metrics** section across crew pages (starting with Socrates, but reusable everywhere) so it matches the rest of the product’s design language. Right now the metrics are flat, gray, and visually weak. They need color, hierarchy, and presence—similar to Speedster’s metric cards and the overall dark + accent aesthetic.

Do NOT change the data. This is a **visual + component styling upgrade** only.

Design requirements (non-negotiable)

1. Card size & layout

* Replace the small, flat stat pills with **larger metric cards**.
* Each metric should feel “first-class”:

  * Taller cards
  * More padding
  * Clear separation between metrics
* Grid layout:

  * 3–4 cards per row on desktop
  * Responsive down to 1–2 on smaller widths

2. Color + emphasis

* Each metric card must have:

  * A subtle colored glow / accent ring / border
  * A matching icon or accent line
* Use existing color language:

  * Green = healthy / positive / completed
  * Yellow = attention / in-progress
  * Red = problem / zero / missing (optional later)
* For now, it’s OK if ALL Key Metrics use **green with green highlights** (as Kevin suggested), as long as:

  * The accent is visible
  * The cards no longer feel gray or disabled

3. Typography hierarchy
   Inside each metric card:

* Metric value (e.g. `176`) → **large and bold**
* Metric label (e.g. `Total Learnings`) → smaller, muted
* Optional helper text below (very subtle, optional)

Example hierarchy:

* Value: 28–32px
* Label: 12–14px
* Accent icon: small but visible

4. Visual language consistency

* Match:

  * Speedster Core Vitals cards
  * Mission Overview styling
  * Dark background + soft glow aesthetic
* Rounded corners should match existing cards
* Shadows/glows should be subtle (no neon)

5. Componentization (important)

* Extract a reusable component:

  * `KeyMetricCard`
  * `KeyMetricsGrid`
* Props example:

  * label
  * value
  * status (optional: good | warning | neutral)
  * accentColor (or derive from status)
* Do NOT hardcode styling per page.

6. Empty / zero states

* Zero values should still look intentional, not broken:

  * Slightly muted accent
  * Still styled as a real card
* Example:

  * “Insights: 0” should look inactive but still polished.

Implementation steps

1. Identify current Key Metrics implementation

* Find where Key Metrics are rendered on Socrates and other crew pages.
* Note current structure (likely simple stat blocks).

2. Build new KeyMetricCard component

* Apply:

  * Dark card background
  * Green accent (border, glow, or top line)
  * Large value typography
* Reuse tokens / CSS variables already used for Speedster where possible.

3. Replace existing Key Metrics rendering

* Swap current stat blocks for the new grid of KeyMetricCard.
* Ensure spacing matches other sections (Mission Overview, Achievements, etc.).

4. Verify visually
   Check at minimum:

* Socrates Key Metrics (176 / 1 / 0 / 0)
* Speedster (ensure no regression)
* One other crew page

Acceptance criteria

* Key Metrics immediately stand out visually.
* They feel consistent with Speedster and Mission Overview.
* They no longer look like placeholder stats.
* No logic or data behavior changes.

Deliverables

* New shared Key Metrics components
* Updated crew pages using them
* Visual confirmation that Key Metrics now feel “alive” and on-brand
