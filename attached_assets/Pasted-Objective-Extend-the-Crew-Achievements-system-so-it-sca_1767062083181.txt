Objective
Extend the Crew Achievements system so it **scales exponentially over time**, allowing each crew member to earn **dozens (50–100+) of achievements** without inventing new concepts endlessly. Core achievements should **level up, tier up, and prestige**, so progress continues indefinitely and rewards keep flowing.

This update modifies the **achievement model**, not just the UI.

Core Design Principle: Exponential Progression, Not Linear Badges

Instead of:

* 10 static achievements per crew → done forever

We want:

* 5–10 **core achievement tracks per crew**
* Each track **levels up exponentially**
* Visual progression continues even when the “type” of work stays the same

Think:

* Same medal, higher class
* Same mission type, greater mastery
* Same action, deeper trust

---

Achievement Structure (New Canon)

Each achievement is now a **Track**, not a one-off.

### Achievement Track

A track represents a concept that can evolve.

Examples:

* “Performance Improvement”
* “Ranking Wins”
* “Safe Deployments”
* “Insight Generation”
* “Autonomous Fixes”

Each track has:

* Levels
* Tiers
* Visual upgrades
* Increasing difficulty thresholds

---

Levels vs Tiers (Important Distinction)

### Levels (Frequent Dopamine)

* Increment often
* Numeric progression (Level 1 → 50+)
* Same badge icon, subtle visual change
* Unlock quickly early, slower later

Example:

* Speedster: “Vitals Scan Master”

  * Level 1: 1 scan
  * Level 2: 5 scans
  * Level 3: 15 scans
  * Level 4: 40 scans
  * Level 5: 100 scans
  * …
  * Level N: exponential growth

### Tiers (Milestones / Prestige)

* Much rarer
* Visual class change
* Narrative weight

Tiers:

* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold
* Platinum
* Mythic (optional, late-game)

Tier unlocks based on **level thresholds**, not separate logic.

---

Exponential Scaling Model (Simple + Safe)

Use a curve like:

* Required value = `base * (growthFactor ^ level)`

Example:

* Base = 5
* Growth factor = 1.7

So:

* Level 1 → 5
* Level 2 → 9
* Level 3 → 15
* Level 4 → 26
* Level 5 → 44
* Level 10 → 350+
* Level 20 → thousands

Early levels feel fast.
Later levels feel earned.

---

Core Tracks Per Crew (5–10 Each)

Every crew should have **a small set of evergreen tracks** that never stop progressing.

### Example: Speedster (Performance)

1. Vitals Scans Run

* Level increases with every successful scan

2. Performance Improvements Delivered

* Increases when metrics actually improve

3. Core Web Vitals Stability

* Increases with days without regression

4. Benchmarks Beaten

* Increases when percentile brackets improve

5. Autonomous Fixes Executed

* Increases when fixes run without rollback

Each of these can reach:

* 20–50 levels easily
* Across months of usage

That’s already 100+ “achievement moments” without inventing fluff.

---

Visual Language (Scaling Without Noise)

### Badge UI

* One badge per track
* Badge shows:

  * Icon
  * Tier (color/material)
  * Level number (small)

Example:

* ⚡ Speedster Performance

  * Gold · Level 17

### Progress Feedback

* Small progress ring or bar
* “Next level in 3 scans” copy
* No modal spam

---

Cross-Crew Consistency

All crews must follow the same pattern:

* 5–10 tracks per crew
* Levels increase infinitely
* Tiers upgrade every N levels
* Same math, different metrics

This keeps the system coherent and debuggable.

---

Data Model Update (Required)

```ts
AchievementTrack {
  id
  crewId
  key
  name
  description
  icon
  currentLevel
  currentTier
  currentValue
  nextThreshold
  baseThreshold
  growthFactor
  lastUpdated
}
```

No one-off “unlocked” booleans anymore.
Everything is progression-based.

---

Evaluation Rules

* Tracks are evaluated after:

  * Worker runs
  * Mission completion
  * Successful fixes
* Updates are incremental and idempotent.
* If multiple levels are crossed at once, grant them silently (no spam).

---

UI Placement (Lightweight)

* Crew dashboard
