You are working in the Arclo Replit codebase (React + TSX + CSS). The homepage hero is close, but it still feels too compact, the value-prop “trust pills” need better copy + unique icons, and there’s a visible 1px purple seam on the right edge of the “Analyze My Website” gradient button. Also the secondary CTA (“Generate a Free Website”) needs a distinct bluish secondary styling (like the older site), not a flat gray/white.

DO THIS IN THREE PARTS:
(1) HERO SPACING / AIR
(2) TRUST PILL ROW (copy + icons + styling)
(3) CTA BUTTON POLISH (remove seam + secondary button color)

========================
(1) HERO SPACING / AIR
========================
Goal: The above-the-fold should feel more premium and open (less cramped), without creating huge empty space.

Find the Home page hero section component (search for headline text “Autonomous SEO that grows traffic — without guesswork.” or the CTA placeholder “Enter your website (example.com)”).

Adjust spacing:
- Add more vertical padding between:
  - header and hero (top padding)
  - headline and subheadline
  - subheadline and step-line
  - step-line and CTA row
  - CTA row and trust pills
Targets (desktop):
- hero container padding-top: 88–110px (depending on sticky header)
- headline margin-bottom: 18–24px
- subheadline margin-bottom: 22–28px
- step-line margin-bottom: 26–34px
- CTA row margin-bottom: 24–30px
- trust pills margin-top: 24–32px

Keep max-width consistent (1120px or existing site max). Ensure mobile has scaled spacing (smaller, but not cramped).

========================
(2) TRUST PILL ROW
========================
Current pills:
“Built for service businesses” (NOT TRUE) → update copy
“Cancel anytime”
“Your changes logged”
“SEO best practices, automated”
Problems:
- No unique icons (currently repeated)
- Copy needs to be more accurate and punchier
- Pills need a slightly more “designed” look (subtle fill + border + icon badge)

Update the 4 value props (exact new copy):
1) “Built for your business”
2) “Cancel anytime”
3) “Changes tracked”
4) “Best practices, automated”

Add UNIQUE icons (use lucide-react if available; otherwise inline SVGs):
- Built for your business: Building2 (or Briefcase)
- Cancel anytime: CalendarX (or XCircle)
- Changes tracked: ClipboardList (or FileText or History)
- Best practices, automated: Sparkles (or Wand2 or BadgeCheck)

Implement pill design:
- pill background: rgba(255,255,255,0.85)
- border: 1px solid rgba(15,23,42,0.10)
- shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(15,23,42,0.06)
- radius: 999px
- padding: 10–14px vertical, 16–18px horizontal
- gap between icon and label: 10–12px
- icon container: 24–28px circle with soft gradient tint (very subtle), plus thin border
- text color: #334155 (or existing slate); font-weight 600; size 14–15px

Ensure pills remain readable over the hero background. On mobile, wrap into 2 rows with consistent spacing.

========================
(3) CTA BUTTON POLISH
========================
A) Fix “Analyze My Website” 1px purple seam on the RIGHT edge.
This is usually caused by:
- border/outline bleeding through
- background-clip / border-radius mismatch
- gradient not reaching the last pixel due to overlay/pseudo-element
- inset shadow or mask

Make these changes on the primary gradient button class:
- border: none !important;
- outline: none !important;
- background-clip: padding-box;
- overflow: hidden;
- border-radius: 12px (match existing)
- remove any ::before/::after that adds a purple edge or outline; if used, make it fully transparent or match gradient.
- ensure gradient ends in ORANGE at 100% (not purple):
  Use a 3-stop gradient like:
  linear-gradient(90deg, #6D28D9 0%, #D946EF 40%, #F59E0B 100%)
  (or the project’s established purple→pink→orange tokens)

Also check for any 1px box-shadow inset on the right. If present, remove inset shadows or set to neutral.

B) Secondary CTA “Generate a Free Website” needs a bluish secondary style (not flat).
Implement a secondary button style:
- background: rgba(59,130,246,0.12) (soft blue tint)
- border: 1px solid rgba(59,130,246,0.22)
- text color: #1D4ED8 (or #2563EB)
- hover: slightly stronger blue tint
- same height as primary CTA (40px), radius 12px, medium weight
This button should clearly look secondary but “designed,” not gray.

Also ensure the “Generate My Site” header button uses the same secondary style (bluish), so the system is consistent:
- Header secondary = blue
- Primary = purple→orange gradient

========================
FILES / HOW TO IMPLEMENT
========================
1) Identify the hero page TSX and the trust pill markup (likely in src/pages/Home*.tsx or src/components/Hero*.tsx).
2) Add or update a CSS file that is used for marketing UI (e.g., src/styles/marketingTheme.css or src/styles/arclo-base.css).
   - Add classes:
     .heroSection
     .heroInner
     .trustPills
     .trustPill
     .trustIcon
     .btnPrimaryGradient
     .btnSecondaryBlue
3) Update the TSX:
   - Replace trust pill copy with the exact new copy above
   - Swap in unique lucide icons per pill
   - Ensure the hero spacing uses the new classes

DELIVERABLES
- Tell me exactly which files you edited and what you changed.
- Confirm these outcomes:
  1) Hero has more breathing room and feels premium (not cramped)
  2) Trust pills have unique icons + updated copy
  3) Primary gradient button has NO 1px purple seam; right edge ends orange
  4) “Generate a Free Website” and header “Generate My Site” use the bluish secondary style
  5) Looks good on desktop + mobile widths

TEST
- Run the app, visually verify on desktop and mobile widths.
- Specifically zoom in on the right edge of the primary button to confirm the seam is gone.
