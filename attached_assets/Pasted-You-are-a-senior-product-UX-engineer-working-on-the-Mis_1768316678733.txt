You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **Mission Control dashboard**. The goal is to make reporting **explicitly action-oriented** and remove ambiguity. Reports should not download or execute immediately — they should always route through a **review-and-send flow**.

This is a **UX + navigation refactor**, not a backend rewrite.

---

## CORE DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

There are **two report actions**, and both behave the same way:

1. **Send Website Report**
2. **Send Developer Report**

Clicking either one should **NOT** immediately export or email anything.

Instead:
👉 Clicking a report card takes the user to a **dedicated review page**, where they can:

* Preview the report
* Choose recipients
* Customize context
* Send (or copy/share)

---

## PART 1 — Update the Primary Action Card Row

### Replace existing report cards

**Remove:**

* “Website Report”
* “Developer Report”
  (as passive view/download actions)

**Add instead:**

### Card 1 (Primary, unchanged)

**Fix Everything For Me**

* Remains the dominant recommendation card
* No change here

---

### Card 2 (Secondary)

**Send Website Report**

**Description:**
“Review and send a clear summary of how your site is performing. This will power weekly reports.”

**CTA (secondary accent):**

> Review Website Report

**Behavior:**

* Navigates to `/reports/website`

---

### Card 3 (Secondary)

**Send Developer Report**

**Description:**
“Review and send a technical report with prioritized issues for your developer or agency.”

**CTA (secondary accent):**

> Review Developer Report

**Behavior:**

* Navigates to `/reports/developer`

---

## PART 2 — Create Dedicated Report Review Pages

You must create **two explicit review pages**.

### A) Website Report Review Page

Route:

* `/reports/website`

Purpose:

* Understanding + communication
* Non-technical
* Executive-friendly

Page sections (in order):

1. **Report Header**

   * Title: “Website Report”
   * Site name
   * Date range (e.g. “Last 30 days”)
   * Short explainer:

     > “This report summarizes your website’s health and progress.”

2. **Preview Content**

   * Health grade
   * Key metrics (owned + sample)
   * Task count summary
   * Trend callouts (even if stubbed)

3. **Send / Share Panel (sticky or bottom)**

   * Recipient email(s)
   * Optional message textarea
   * Toggle:

     * “Send weekly going forward” (future hook)
   * Primary CTA:

     > Send Website Report

4. **Secondary Actions**

   * Copy shareable link
   * Download PDF (optional, later)

---

### B) Developer Report Review Page

Route:

* `/reports/developer`

Purpose:

* Delegation
* Technical clarity
* No sales language

Page sections:

1. **Report Header**

   * Title: “Developer Report”
   * Subtitle:

     > “Prioritized technical issues and recommended fixes”

2. **Preview Content**

   * Technical findings
   * Tasks with impact/effort
   * Clear, neutral language
   * No “Fix Everything” upsells here

3. **Send / Share Panel**

   * Recipient email(s)
   * Optional message
   * Primary CTA:

     > Send Developer Report

4. **Secondary Actions**

   * Copy link
   * Download PDF

---

## PART 3 — Navigation & UX RULES (IMPORTANT)

* Reports are **never sent without review**
* No “instant export”
* No surprise emails
* The user always sees **what they’re about to send**

This builds trust and avoids “what just happened?” moments.

---

## PART 4 — Language & Labeling Rules

Use **SEND** consistently:

* “Send Website Report”
* “Send Developer Report”

Avoid:

* Export
* Generate (ambiguous)
* Fix Pack

This reinforces that reports are **communication tools**, not files.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking this done, verify:

* Mission Control shows:

  * Fix Everything For Me (primary)
  * Send Website Report
  * Send Developer Report
* Clicking either report card:

  * Navigates to a review page
  * Does NOT immediately send anything
* Each report page:

  * Has a clear preview
  * Has explicit send controls
  * Feels intentional and safe

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Execution should be instant. Communication should be reviewed.**

Fixing things can be automated.
Sending reports should always feel deliberate.

Implement this flow before adding any additional report types or email automation.
