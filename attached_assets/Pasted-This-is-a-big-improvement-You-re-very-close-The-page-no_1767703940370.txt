This is a big improvement. You’re very close. The page no longer feels bloated — but it still feels a bit heavier than it needs to at the very top, and that’s now mostly a copy hierarchy issue, not design.

I’ll break this into (1) what’s working, (2) what’s still causing friction, and (3) very specific tweaks + dev instructions.

⸻

1. What’s Working Well (Keep These)

You fixed the right things:
	•	✅ Clear primary action (URL → scan)
	•	✅ “No setup / no logins / ~60 seconds” is excellent friction-reduction copy
	•	✅ CTA is visually strong and obvious
	•	✅ Dark theme + gradient feels premium, not gimmicky
	•	✅ Headline is benefit-oriented (action plan, no setup)

This already converts much better than the previous version.

⸻

2. What Still Feels Heavy (Very Specific)

There are three pressure points, all above the fold:

A. Headline is still doing two jobs

“Get a complete SEO action plan from your website — no setup required.”

This explains what it is and why it’s easy. That’s slightly too much for the very first line.

It’s a good headline, just ~20% too long for mobile-first scanning.

⸻

B. Subheadline repeats the same idea in a denser way

“Enter your website URL and Arclo automatically scans it for technical issues, keyword opportunities, and competitor gaps — then turns it into a clear, prioritized plan.”

This is accurate, but:
	•	Long sentence
	•	Multiple concepts
	•	Feels like documentation, not persuasion

Users already decided what it does from the headline.
Now they need reassurance, not detail.

⸻

C. CTA label is slightly misaligned with the promise

Button says:

Free Health Check

But the headline promise is:

SEO action plan

Those are close, but not identical. This creates a tiny moment of hesitation:

“Is this a quick check… or something more useful?”

Small mismatch, but worth fixing.

⸻

3. Exact Improvements (Low Effort, High Impact)

1️⃣ Simplify the headline (do this first)

Current

Get a complete SEO action plan from your website — no setup required.

Recommended

Get a complete SEO action plan — no setup required.

Or even stronger:

Your SEO action plan — no setup required.

This reduces cognitive load immediately.

Dev instruction
	•	Change H1 text only
	•	Do not change font size or layout yet

⸻

2️⃣ Replace the subheadline with a lighter reassurance line

Current

Enter your website URL and Arclo automatically scans it for technical issues, keyword opportunities, and competitor gaps — then turns it into a clear, prioritized plan.

Replace with one of these (pick one):
	•	“See exactly what’s holding your site back and what to fix first.”
	•	“Find the issues costing you traffic — and the fastest way to fix them.”
	•	“Understand what to fix, why it matters, and what to do next.”

These are:
	•	Shorter
	•	Outcome-focused
	•	Less technical

Dev instruction
	•	Keep it to one line
	•	Max ~90 characters
	•	No commas if possible

⸻

3️⃣ Align the CTA text with the promise

Current CTA

Free Health Check

Better options
	•	Get Free SEO Action Plan
	•	Get My Free SEO Plan
	•	Run Free SEO Plan

This reinforces that the output is a plan, not a shallow scan.

Dev instruction
	•	Update button label only
	•	Keep color, size, animation unchanged

⸻

4️⃣ Move the “Built for people…” line closer to the CTA

Right now it’s visually separated and easy to miss.

That line is emotionally strong:

Built for people who don’t want to think about SEO

It works best as emotional validation just before action.

Dev instruction
	•	Move this line to:
	•	Just above the URL input or
	•	Just below the CTA button
	•	Reduce opacity slightly so it feels supportive, not dominant

⸻

4. Ideal Final Above-the-Fold (Exact Copy)

Here’s what the hero should read like after tweaks:

Eyebrow (small)
Built for people who don’t want to think about SEO

H1
Get a complete SEO action plan — no setup required.

Subheadline
See exactly what’s holding your site back and what to fix first.

Input
Enter your website (example.com)

CTA
Get Free SEO Action Plan

Microcopy
No logins • No integrations • Takes ~60 seconds

That’s it. No extra explanation needed above the fold.

⸻

5. Why This Will Convert Better

These changes:
	•	Reduce reading time by ~30–40%
	•	Eliminate duplication
	•	Align promise → button → outcome
	•	Make the decision feel obvious, not evaluative

You want users thinking:

“Sure, I’ll try it.”

Not:

“Let me fully understand this first.”

⸻

6. Explicit Dev To-Do List (You Can Paste This)
	1.	Shorten H1 to remove “from your website”
	2.	Replace subheadline with a single outcome-focused sentence
	3.	Change CTA text to reference “SEO plan”
	4.	Reposition “Built for people who don’t want to think about SEO” closer to the CTA
	5.	Do not add any new sections or animations

This is a copy polish pass, not a redesign.

⸻

Bottom line

You’re 90% there.
The page looks good — it just needs to say less, faster.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Write 2 A/B headline variants to test
	•	Tune this specifically for cold traffic vs warm traffic
	•	Review the scan → report transition screen for drop-off

But this version is already a solid foundation.
