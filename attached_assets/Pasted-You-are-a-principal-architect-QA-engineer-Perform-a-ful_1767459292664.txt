You are a principal architect + QA engineer. Perform a full “Reality & Wiring” architecture review of this Hermes SEO / Arclo app.

Objective
Verify that every page and every worker integration is:
- Connected to the correct backend endpoints
- Returning real data (not placeholders/mocks)
- Persisting the correct entities to the database
- Using a single source of truth for shared metrics
Then produce a prioritized fix plan for anything that is not real, not wired, or inconsistent.

Scope
A) Pages (UI)
- Mission Control (dashboard)
- Each Agent page (Natasha, Lookout, Scotty, Sentinel, Hemingway, Beacon, Atlas, Draper, Speedster, Popular, Draper, Socrates, etc.)
- Any settings/integrations pages relevant to workers

B) Workers / Services
Verify every worker that is referenced by the UI:
- Competitive Intel
- SERP / Keyword ranking
- Technical crawler
- Core Web Vitals
- Blog writer
- Content validator
- Content decay monitor
- Notifications
- Backlinks
- Audit log
- Orchestrator
- Deployer
- Any “AI Optimization / Atlas” endpoints
- Any Draper / Ads endpoints (note: Draper worker not connected yet — it should be explicitly flagged as stubbed)

C) Database
Verify data persistence for:
- snapshots/trends tables
- findings tables (technical, decay, quality, AI, etc.)
- action queue tables
- agent configuration tables
- competitor tables (Natasha)

Outputs (deliverables)
1) Wiring Inventory Report (table-like list, but no long prose in tables)
For each page section/widget:
- Page → Widget/Section → API endpoint(s) called → DB table(s) read/written → Worker/service dependency → Real vs Placeholder → Notes

2) Single Source of Truth Map
For each shared metric:
- Metric name → canonical source function/helper (shared aggregator) → DB source (if persisted) → pages that display it
Confirm there are no alternate computations.

3) Gap + Fix Backlog (prioritized)
For each issue:
- Severity (Blocker / High / Medium / Low)
- Symptom
- Root cause (mock data, endpoint mismatch, missing persistence, incorrect routing, wrong aggregation, missing worker capability)
- Proposed fix (code location suggestions)
- Verification steps

4) Proof checklist
For every worker integration:
- a) request succeeds (HTTP 200)
- b) response schema matches what UI expects
- c) UI renders non-placeholder values
- d) database writes occur where required
- e) subsequent page loads read from DB and match the worker outputs

Hard requirements
- Actively hunt placeholders: search for “mock”, “placeholder”, “sample”, hardcoded arrays, default dummy numbers, and “TODO worker not connected” banners.
- Validate that any value shown on an agent page that is “real” is also reflected consistently anywhere else it appears.

Specific known mismatch to use as a test case (must fix)
Socrates mismatch:
- Socrates agent page shows real data (KPIs/findings/etc.)
- Mission Control “Socrates” card shows missing/empty or inconsistent data
This must be resolved by ensuring the Mission Control card consumes the same canonical data source as the Socrates page (same endpoint/DB table/aggregator), not a separate or stubbed dataset.

Procedure (do this step-by-step)
1) Build a page-by-page “reality scan”
- Open each agent page.
- For each section: check network calls, console logs, and confirm values are not placeholders.
- Record findings in the Wiring Inventory Report.

2) Trace each widget to code
- Locate the component file for each widget.
- Identify the API call / query hook used.
- Identify the server route handler.
- Identify worker base URL/env var used.
- Identify DB reads/writes (drizzle queries).

3) Worker verification
For each worker used:
- Confirm correct base URL config exists (check server configs/env variables).
- Confirm auth headers exist where needed.
- Call the endpoint manually or via server route and confirm non-empty payloads.
- If worker returns insufficient fields, log as “worker capability gap” with required schema additions.

4) Canonicalize shared metrics
- Identify any metric computed in multiple places (e.g., ranked/not ranked, position distribution, Market SOV).
- Refactor so all pages use a single shared helper and/or a single DB snapshot source.
- Ensure Mission Control uses the same canonical sources as agent pages.

5) Fix + persist gaps
If data exists (worker returns it) but UI shows blanks:
- Fix mapping/schema mismatch
- Persist to DB if needed for Trends or cross-page reuse
If data does not exist:
- Add a DB table and persistence pipeline OR
- Update worker spec and stub with explicit “worker not connected” banner (only acceptable for Draper until connected)

6) Final verification pass
- Re-run the full scan after fixes.
- Confirm no console errors.
- Confirm Mission Control cards match agent page metrics.

Acceptance criteria (definition of done)
- Every page and widget is labeled internally as “Real (worker-backed)” or “Stub (explicit)”.
- No silent placeholders. If stubbed, it is clearly bannered and has zeros (not fake numbers).
- Socrates Mission Control card matches Socrates page data.
- Shared metrics are computed once and reused everywhere.
- A prioritized fix backlog exists for remaining worker gaps and routing mismatches.

Start now
Begin by scanning Mission Control and each agent page, building the Wiring Inventory Report as you go. Then trace to code, validate workers, and produce the fix backlog.
