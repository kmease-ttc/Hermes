Perfect — the screenshots make the issue very clear. You’re right: Mission Control currently looks like three separate systems, while the Crew page has a single, cohesive “attention widget.” The fix here is mostly structural + visual unification, not new UI.

Below is a final, corrective prompt you can hand to Replit that is laser-focused on making Mission Control match the Crew page style exactly.

This prompt explicitly references what’s wrong now and what “done” looks like.

FINAL ALIGNMENT PROMPT — Mission Control ↔ Crew Page

You are a senior ARCLO frontend engineer.

We have a visual inconsistency between the Mission Control dashboard and the Crew page.
On the Crew page, missions and status are presented as one cohesive widget.
On Mission Control, they are fragmented into multiple cards.

Your task is to refactor Mission Control so the Mission section visually and structurally matches the Crew page pattern.

This is a style and layout alignment task, not a feature change.

⸻

THE PROBLEM (CURRENT STATE)

Mission Control currently renders:
	1.	A “Mission Status” card
	2.	A separate “Critical / Score” card
	3.	A separate “MISSIONS” list section

These appear as three unrelated sections, stacked vertically, with different visual treatments.

This feels disjointed and does NOT match the Crew page experience.

⸻

THE TARGET STATE (WHAT “GOOD” LOOKS LIKE)

Mission Control must look like the Crew page consolidated mission widget:
	•	One card
	•	One surface
	•	One mental model
	•	Clear hierarchy inside the card

If you compare the screenshots:
	•	Crew page = ✅ cohesive, calm, unified
	•	Mission Control = ❌ fragmented, noisy, redundant

We want Mission Control to behave like a top-level Crew widget, not a dashboard made of parts.

⸻

REQUIRED SOLUTION

Create / finalize a single component:

<MissionWidget />

This widget must replace all three of the following on Mission Control:
	•	Mission Status card
	•	Critical score card
	•	Missions list section

After this change, Mission Control should show one Missions widget, just like the Crew page.

⸻

STRUCTURE (MATCH CREW PAGE EXACTLY)

1. Widget Container
	•	Same container style as Crew widgets
	•	Same border radius
	•	Same padding
	•	Same subtle amber/yellow attention tint
	•	Same visual weight

Do NOT invent a new card style.

⸻

2. Header Row (Crew-style)
	•	Title: Missions
	•	Status pill: Needs attention / Critical / Good
	•	Right side: at most one primary action
	•	Generate Plan OR Run Diagnostics
	•	Secondary action only if absolutely necessary

This header should visually read the same way Crew widgets do.

⸻

3. Summary Row (Crew-style)

Directly under the header, inside the same card:
	•	Left: Score badge (reuse the existing circular score UI)
	•	Center:
→ Next: Focus on fixing poor metrics first
(This replaces the separate “Mission Status” card entirely.)
	•	Right:
{X} missions • {Y} blockers

This row is the unifying glue — it’s what makes the section feel whole.

⸻

4. Missions List (Embedded, Not Separate)

Inside the same widget:
	•	Render missions as compact rows
	•	Same row density as Crew page items
	•	Show max 2–3 missions by default
	•	Each row includes:
	•	Icon(s)
	•	Mission title
	•	Subtext
	•	Right-aligned action (Fix it, Generate Plan, etc.)

If more missions exist:
	•	Show a “View all” affordance
	•	Do NOT spill into a separate section

⸻

5. Blockers (Inside the Widget)
	•	Blockers must live inside the Mission widget
	•	Render as a collapsible subsection at the bottom
	•	Same collapsible pattern used elsewhere in Crew widgets
	•	Default state: collapsed

Blockers should NOT feel like a separate alert panel.

⸻

COLOR & TINT REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
	•	Use the same amber/yellow-tinted surface seen on the Crew page when attention is needed
	•	Tint applies to the widget background, not the text
	•	Text remains neutral (white / muted gray)
	•	Pills, icons, and dividers can lean amber

Do NOT:
	•	Add red backgrounds
	•	Use warning banners
	•	Increase contrast beyond Crew page levels

This is “quiet attention,” not “panic mode.”

⸻

WHAT TO DELETE / REMOVE
	•	Remove the standalone “Mission Status” card
	•	Remove the standalone “Critical” score card
	•	Remove the standalone “MISSIONS” section header

There should be one Missions surface, not three.

⸻

FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before marking complete, confirm:
	•	Mission Control’s Missions section visually matches the Crew page widget
	•	Status, score, next action, missions, and blockers all live in ONE card
	•	Amber/yellow tint matches Crew page exactly
	•	Vertical space usage is reduced
	•	No duplicated status information exists elsewhere on the page

If the Mission Control widget feels louder, taller, or more complex than the Crew widget, it’s wrong.

⸻

SUCCESS CRITERION (VERY CLEAR)

If you took the Mission widget from Mission Control and dropped it onto the Crew page, it should look native without modification.

That is the bar.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Draw an ASCII wireframe of the final widget
	•	Write a drop-in JSX skeleton matching the Crew widget line-for-line
	•	Create a before/after diff checklist for QA

Just say the word.
