You are a senior UX designer and product lead launching a new consumer startup in the SEO automation space.

The product promise is simple and bold: **SEO runs automatically in the background. Users do not need to review reports, understand SEO, or make decisions.**

Design a “How It Works” page that feels:

* Calm
* Modern
* Trustworthy
* Consumer-first (not SaaS-internal, not developer-facing)
* Confident without being loud

This is not a documentation page. It is a reassurance page.

### Audience

* Small business owners
* Founders
* Operators
* Non-technical users who want results, not tools

They are anxious about SEO and tired of dashboards. The design should *remove responsibility*, not add it.

---

### Visual Tone & Style

* Light, airy, and high-contrast (no dark mode)
* Generous white space
* Large, readable typography
* Minimal copy
* Rounded cards and soft borders
* One strong brand accent color (used sparingly)
* Icons are simple, modern, outline-style, and consistent — never decorative

The page should feel closer to a premium consumer service (like payroll automation or background monitoring) than a SaaS product walkthrough.

---

### Content Structure

#### Hero Section

Headline:
**SEO that runs on autopilot**

Subhead (one sentence only):
Hermes finds issues, fixes them automatically, and keeps your site optimized — without you reviewing reports or making decisions.

No paragraphs. No jargon. No explanation.

---

#### Primary Reassurance Callout (Visually Prominent)

A full-width callout with subtle emphasis:

**No work required**
Hermes runs automatically in the background. You’ll only hear from us when something improves — or if action is needed.

This block should visually anchor the page. It is the emotional core.

---

#### Outcome Cards (Not Steps)

Replace any “step-by-step” flow with **three outcome-focused cards**, arranged horizontally.

Each card contains:

* A simple icon (above text)
* A short headline
* One supporting sentence

Card 1:
**We find what’s broken**
Continuous scans catch technical issues, content gaps, and missed opportunities.

Card 2:
**We fix it automatically**
Hermes applies proven fixes in the background — no approvals, no reviews required.

Card 3:
**Your traffic improves**
Rankings and performance improve over time while you focus on your business.

No bullets. No sub-paragraphs. Each card must be readable in under 2 seconds.

---

#### Responsibility Removal Section

Explicitly remove cognitive load from the user.

Headline:
**You don’t need to review SEO reports**

Body (2 lines max):
Hermes generates reports for transparency, not decision-making. You can ignore them completely and let everything run automatically.

This section is critical for consumer trust.

---

#### CTA Section

Close with confidence, not urgency.

Headline:
**Want to be completely hands-off?**

Primary CTA:
**Fix my SEO automatically**

Secondary (optional, de-emphasized):
See what will change

The CTA should feel safe, calm, and obvious — not salesy.

---

### Design Principles to Enforce

* Headlines do the work; body copy reassures
* One sentence per block max
* Icons reinforce meaning, not decorate
* No “how our system works” language
* No implication that the user should learn SEO
* The page should scan in 8–10 seconds and still feel complete

---

### Emotional Goal

After scrolling this page, the user should feel:

> “Oh. I don’t have to think about this anymore.”

That feeling matters more than explaining anything.

Design for relief, not curiosity.
