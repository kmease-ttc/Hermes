Got it — you’re talking about **adding an “Achievements / Wins” section to each agent (career/crew) page**, showing what that agent has won or received.

Here’s the clean way to do it so it’s consistent, useful, and not noisy.

---

## Intent of the “Achievements” section

Answer one question:

**What has this agent actually accomplished?**

This gives credibility and makes each agent feel earned, not decorative.

---

## What should count as an achievement

Achievements should be **derived from real system outcomes**, not manual badges.

Good candidates (ranked by value):

### 1) Ranking wins

* “Reached Top 3 for X keywords”
* “Moved 12 keywords into Top 10”
* “Achieved #1 for ‘psychiatrist near me’”

Trigger logic:

* Lookout keyword data
* Compare last snapshot vs previous
* Only award when a threshold is crossed (first time or net gain)

---

### 2) Share of Voice milestones

* “Market SOV exceeded 50%”
* “Tracked SOV increased by 15% in 30 days”

Trigger logic:

* Snapshot table you already added
* One-time awards per milestone

---

### 3) Competitive wins (Natasha-specific)

* “Outranked PsychologyToday for 5 keywords”
* “Displaced RegionalPsychiatry from Top 3”

Trigger logic:

* Competitor SERP snapshots
* Detect when your rank beats a competitor consistently (e.g., 3+ runs)

---

### 4) Execution impact

* “Published 8 pages that entered Top 20”
* “Resolved 14 keyword gaps”

Trigger logic:

* Actions executed via “Fix it”
* Tie actions → ranking outcomes

---

## How it should appear in the UI

### Placement

* **Top-right or below KPIs** on each agent page
* Collapsible (“Show all” after 3–5 items)

### Format

Each achievement should have:

* Icon (trophy, crown, upward arrow)
* Short title
* Subtext with metric
* Date achieved

Example:

```
🏆 Top 3 Breakthrough  
Reached Top 3 for 7 high-intent keywords  
Jan 2026
```

---

## Data model (simple + extensible)

Create a table like:

```
agent_achievements
- id
- agent_slug
- type (ranking | sov | competitor | execution)
- title
- description
- value (json)
- created_at
```

Achievements are **written automatically** when rules trigger — not manually edited.

---

## One important rule

❌ Do NOT show achievements that are:

* Ongoing states (“currently ranked”)
* Duplicated across agents
* Not attributable to that agent’s mission

Each agent earns **different wins**.

---

## If you want the exact implementation prompt

Say the word and I’ll generate a **Replit-ready prompt** that:

* Adds the achievements table
* Computes achievements from snapshots + Lookout data
* Renders the UI block on every agent page
* Backfills initial achievements from existing data

Right now, conceptually:
**Yes — every agent should show what they’ve actually won.**
And you already have 90% of the data needed to do it properly.
