You are a senior product + UX engineer refining the **Capabilities & Performance** grid. The active cards look great. The locked/greyed-out cards currently look too “dead” and reduce perceived value. Your task is to redesign the locked state so it feels **aspirational and premium**, while still clearly communicating that it’s not enabled.

This is a **visual + copy polish** only.

---

## CORE GOAL

Locked cards should feel like:

> “This looks valuable — I want to unlock it.”

Not like:

> “This is disabled and irrelevant.”

---

## LOCKED CARD VISUAL SYSTEM (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1) Keep them clearly distinct from Active

Locked must remain visually subdued vs active. But:

* do NOT make them low-contrast blobs
* do NOT make them look broken

### 2) Introduce a “premium locked” treatment

Locked cards should have:

* subtle glass background (still premium)
* a faint crew-color glow (very low opacity)
* a “Locked” badge that’s more intentional
* an internal “Unlock value” teaser line

---

## SPECIFIC UI CHANGES

### A) Replace heavy blur on KPI with a “sample preview”

Right now the KPI is blurred so hard it looks like a glitch.

Change to one of these:
Option 1 (best):

* Show KPI in normal typography but **muted opacity** + “Sample” chip

Option 2:

* Show KPI with a very light blur + low opacity (only slight blur)

Do NOT make it unreadable. The user should be able to infer value.

Example:
~12.4K  (Sample)

---

### B) Add a value proposition line (one-liner)

Under the KPI label, add a one-line “why it matters” teaser.

Examples:

* Popular: “Track traffic trends and conversions”
* Lookout: “Monitor keyword movement and visibility”
* Beacon: “Measure authority and link equity”
* Natasha: “Spot competitor gaps and opportunities”

This is crucial: locked cards need meaning.

---

### C) Improve the badge

Replace the current plain “Locked” pill with:

* icon + label
* slightly better contrast
* optional “Setup required” for those states

Examples:

* “Locked” (lock icon)
* “Setup required” (gear icon)

---

### D) Make the CTA stronger and consistent

At the bottom right:

* Keep “Enable →”
* But make it feel clickable and intentional:

  * use a subtle purple accent (not gray)
  * add hover state even when locked

Optionally change label from “Enable” to:

* “Unlock”
  or
* “Enable”

Use “Unlock” for locked cards; “Configure” for setup-required.

---

### E) Add a “what you get” micro-chip

Add a small chip above the CTA:

* “Unlocks X tasks”
  or
* “Unlocks monitoring”

This ties locked state directly to value.

---

## HOVER STATE (IMPORTANT)

Locked cards should have a delightful hover:

* lift slightly
* border/glow intensifies just a bit
* CTA becomes brighter

This makes them feel interactive and premium, not dead.

---

## COLOR / GLOW RULES

Locked cards:

* base card remains neutral glass
* add a faint crew color glow:

  * 10–20% opacity maximum
  * do NOT compete with active cards

Active cards still:

* get full crew color glow

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before finishing, verify:

* Locked cards still clearly look locked
* But they feel premium and enticing
* KPI sample is legible (not destroyed by blur)
* Each locked card explains what it unlocks
* Hover makes the user want to click “Unlock”

If the locked cards feel like a dead end, redo until they feel like a “teaser.”

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> Locked is not disabled. Locked is upsell.

The user should think:

> “Oh, that looks useful — I should enable it.”

Not:

> “Meh, I’ll ignore that.”
