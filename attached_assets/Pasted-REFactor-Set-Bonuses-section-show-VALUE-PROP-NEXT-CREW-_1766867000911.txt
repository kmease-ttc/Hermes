REFactor Set Bonuses section: show VALUE PROP + NEXT CREW TO ADD (not just agent names)

The current Set Bonuses cards list agent requirements (Popular, Lookout, Natasha). That’s backwards.
Set Bonuses must sell the COMBO BENEFIT and guide the user to the NEXT CREW to add.

For each Set Bonus card, change layout to:

1) Header:
- Title (e.g. “Revenue Attribution”)
- One-sentence value prop under title:
  “Connect SEO work to traffic and conversions so you know what’s actually paying off.”

2) Progress:
- Display: “Progress: X / N systems online”
- Optional tiny progress bar under it (subtle gold)

3) Next recommended crew to add:
- Determine the first missing required agent (in priority order defined in the set bonus requirements)
- Render a “Next to unlock:” row:
  “Next to unlock: Popular (Signals)”
  Button: “Select Popular”
- Clicking “Select {agent}” should:
  a) add agentId to previewSelected set (NOT enabled)
  b) update the ship tile to Selected (semi-opaque)
  c) update the progress display on this card

4) Missing list (greyed):
- Render missing agents as grey chips with icons if available.
- Chips are clickable: open the crew modal for that agent.

5) Only show the full requirement list in small muted text if needed, but do NOT make requirements the main content.

STATE RULES
- If the set is fully active (all required agents enabled), show “Active” and a gold check.
- If partial, show the Next-to-unlock CTA.
- If locked (0/N), show the Next-to-unlock CTA and grey chips.

COPY RULES
- Do NOT list bare agent names without benefit context.
- Always lead with value prop.
- “Select” = preview add to ship (no billing).
- Enabling happens only in the crew modal.

DATA MODEL
Update setBonuses config to include:
- id
- title
- valueProp (1 sentence)
- outcomes (optional 1–2 bullets)
- requirements: agentIds[] (ordered)
- activationCopy (optional)

Acceptance criteria:
- Set bonus cards read like benefits, not checklists
- Each set bonus clearly tells the user what to add next
- Clicking Select updates ship preview state and progress number
- Clicking a missing chip opens modal for that agent
