Here’s a clean spec you can hand straight to your dev / Replit agent.

Goal:
	1.	Stop using ad-hoc colors and stock logos.
	2.	Use a curated “flat color” library (like the screenshot) for every site.
	3.	Generate a simple, custom logo via prompt using the customer’s info.
	4.	Standardize button styles so everything looks like one product.

No code, just behavior + rules.

1. Overall Design Goals

For every generated site:
	1.	Colors come from a fixed palette library (similar to the “flat colors” sets in the screenshot), never random RGB.
	2.	Buttons have a consistent, premium look across all sites.
	3.	The logo is AI-generated for that business, not a generic stock/star/placeholder.
	4.	The hero section always looks intentional:
	•	clear contrast
	•	beautiful color combo
	•	logo + buttons that match the palette.

2. Color Palette Library (Replace Existing Color Logic)

2.1 Palette Structure

Create a library of palettes. Each palette should contain at least:
	•	primary – used for main buttons and key accents
	•	secondary – used for secondary buttons, highlights
	•	accent – used sparingly for badges, icons, small highlights
	•	bg_light – main light background
	•	bg_dark – hero / dark sections, or used as overlay
	•	text_on_light – near-black or deep gray
	•	text_on_dark – off-white

Think of each row in the screenshot (4–6 swatches) as one palette. Map those swatches into this structure.

2.2 Palette Library Source & Style
	•	Build a library of 20–30 palettes inspired by “flat color” sets like the screenshot:
	•	No neon
	•	No muddy low-contrast combos
	•	All palettes must look good in flat UI (not just illustration).
	•	Every palette must be tested once in a sample hero layout before being accepted into the library.

2.3 Palette Selection Rules

The generator should only use palettes from this library.

Use basic industry → palette mapping:
	•	Trades (plumbing, HVAC, electricians, roofers):
	•	Blue/teal/indigo + neutral gray palettes
	•	Medical / wellness / dental:
	•	Teal/green + light neutral palettes (“fresh/clean”)
	•	Corporate / B2B / software:
	•	Indigo, navy, slate palettes
	•	Creative / interiors / design:
	•	Purple/gold, mocha/sand, or more colorful combos
	•	Landscaping / outdoor / farm:
	•	Forest green + sage, earthy palettes

If the industry is unknown, pick from a small “safe default” subset (e.g., 3–4 modern indigo/blue palettes).

2.4 Usage Rules
	•	Hero background uses bg_dark + optional subtle gradient overlay, not aggressive colored filters over the photo.
	•	Main page backgrounds use bg_light.
	•	Body text on light sections uses text_on_light; on dark sections uses text_on_dark.
	•	Never overlay a strong tinted color over hero photos that makes faces or office scenes look green/purple (like the MRI screenshot). Keep photos mostly natural; use a subtle dark gradient only for readability.

2.5 Contrast & Accessibility

Before marking a preview as “ready,” automatically check:
	•	Primary button text vs button background meets AA contrast.
	•	Hero headline vs background meets AA contrast.
	•	Do not accept palettes/usage where white text sits on mid-tone colors that are too light.

If contrast fails, either:
	•	Darken the overlay on the hero, or
	•	Switch text color to text_on_light or text_on_dark accordingly, or
	•	Pick a different palette.

3. Button Design System

Standardize buttons across all generated sites.

3.1 Primary Buttons
	•	Background: primary from palette
	•	Text: text_on_dark (usually white/off-white)
	•	Shape: pill/rounded rectangle (10–12px corner radius)
	•	Size:
	•	Height: visually ~44–52px
	•	Padding: generous (e.g., 14–16px vertical, 20–24px horizontal)
	•	Style:
	•	Slight shadow (soft, not heavy)
	•	Flat or very subtle gradient within the palette (no glossy 3D look)
	•	Hover:
	•	Slightly darker or lighter shade of primary
	•	Slight increase in shadow or subtle scale (1.02x)
	•	Disabled/secondary state: be clearly different (muted, less shadow).

3.2 Secondary Buttons (e.g., “Call Now”)
	•	Background: bg_light or transparent
	•	Border: 1–2px primary
	•	Text: primary
	•	Same corner radius and padding as primary
	•	Icon on left (phone, mail, etc.) with consistent size and spacing
	•	Hover: fill with a very light tint of the primary color, or slightly darken border.

3.3 Button Placement Rules
	•	In hero:
	•	Primary action first (e.g., “Get Started”, “Get a Quote”)
	•	Secondary “Call Now” button second
	•	Maintain at least 16–24px vertical spacing between text and buttons.
	•	On mobile, stack buttons full-width with 8–12px vertical gap.

4. Logo Generation (No More Stock Logos)

The current logo (“star”, generic icons, etc.) must be replaced with a prompt-based, business-specific logo.

4.1 Inputs for Logo Generation

When a project is created, collect or infer:
	•	Business name (required)
	•	Industry / category (HVAC, dentist, florist, plumber, etc.)
	•	Brand feel if available (friendly, premium, playful, serious)
	•	Palette’s primary & secondary colors

If the customer gives a website URL and we can extract an existing logo, that can be used as a reference, but if not, we must generate a new one.

4.2 Logo Generation Behavior
	•	Generate at least one logo per customer using the AI image model.
	•	Logo style:
	•	Simple, flat, modern
	•	Icon + wordmark (text)
	•	Icon not overly literal clipart; more of a symbolic or geometric metaphor
	•	No 3D, no photo, no complex gradients
	•	Uses the selected palette’s colors (primary / secondary)
	•	Avoid:
	•	Default “star” or generic shapes used across sites
	•	Harsh outlines or neon colors
	•	Overly detailed illustrations

4.3 Prompt Guidelines (for internal use)

When calling the model, construct a prompt like:

“Design a simple, modern flat logo for a business named {BusinessName}.
Industry: {Industry description}.
Style: clean, minimal, professional, suitable for a website header.
Use a flat icon plus the business name as a wordmark.
Use these brand colors: {PrimaryColor}, {SecondaryColor}.
Avoid 3D effects, gradients, photos, and detailed scenes.
No text inside the icon, only shapes.”

The system can store both:
	•	A horizontal logo (icon + text) for the navbar
	•	A square icon for favicon and mobile

4.4 Fallbacks
	•	If logo generation fails, retry once.
	•	If it still fails:
	•	Use a text-only wordmark styled with the palette (e.g., business name in a nice typeface, colored with primary), but this should be rare.
	•	Do not fall back to the old generic stock icon set.

4.5 Preview Quality Gate

A site must not be marked “Preview Ready” unless:
	•	A logo image is present (generated or high-quality extracted) OR a clean text wordmark is in place.
	•	The logo’s colors do not clash with the overall palette (prefer using palette colors).

5. QA / Acceptance Criteria

Before a generated site is shown to users:
	1.	Colors:
	•	All colors used come from a palette in the library.
	•	Hero background, buttons, badges, and text adhere to the palette structure.
	•	No strange color overlays (like green tinting the office photo).
	2.	Buttons:
	•	Primary and secondary buttons match the system described above.
	•	“Call Now” always appears styled as a secondary button with icon.
	•	On both desktop and mobile, buttons are large enough and readable.
	3.	Logo:
	•	The navbar contains a logo that clearly references the business name.
	•	The logo does not look like a random star or generic placeholder.
	•	The logo color coordinates with the palette.
	4.	Overall feel:
	•	If you screen-shot the hero, it should look like a real, professionally designed site for that business, not a template with mismatched colors and random icon.

You can give this entire spec to your dev/agent as:

“New design system for generated sites — implement palette library, button system, and prompt-based logo generation exactly as described, and enforce the preview quality checks before we ever show ‘Preview Ready’.”
