Create a new “Examples / Success Stories” page that feels like a real portfolio of Arclo-built sites and is easy to expand over time.

Use this as the implementation brief.

---

### 1. New Route + Navigation

* Add a new page at:

  * Path: `/examples` (or `/success-stories`, pick one and keep it consistent)
  * Component: `client/src/pages/Examples.tsx`
* In the main navbar:

  * Add a new link: `Examples`
  * Clicking it routes to `/examples`.

---

### 2. Page Goal + Content Strategy

The page should:

* Show real projects built/managed by us (Empathy, Lucky Thunder, The Farm, etc.).
* Make it obvious what Arclo did for each project:

  * “What we built” (site, structure, content, SEO)
  * “What improved” (traffic, rankings, bookings, leads)
* Feel like a **case-study grid**, not a wall of text.

---

### 3. Data Model (so we can add examples easily)

Create a small data file, e.g.:

* `client/src/data/examples.ts`

Shape:

```ts
export type ExampleProject = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  industry: string;              // "Psychiatry Clinic", "Property Management", "Glamping / Hospitality"
  siteUrl: string;
  image: string;                 // path to screenshot/hero mockup
  logo?: string;                 // optional
  headline: string;              // short result statement
  summary: string;               // 2–3 sentence summary
  metrics?: {
    label: string;               // "Organic traffic"
    value: string;               // "+84%"
  }[];
  highlights: string[];          // bullet points: "New local SEO structure", etc.
  tags: string[];                // ["Local SEO", "Content", "Website Redesign"]
};
```

Populate initial examples:

1. Empathy Health Clinic
2. Lucky Thunder Property Management
3. The Farm Texas

Use real domain URLs and screenshots we provide.

---

### 4. Page Layout

Overall layout:

* Background: same dark navy gradient as home hero, or light background if that reads better.
* Max width: `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-8`
* Vertical spacing: `py-16 md:py-24`

Sections:

1. **Hero**
2. **Filter / Tag Row** (optional but preferred)
3. **Examples Grid**
4. **CTA Footer**

---

### 5. Hero Section (top of Examples page)

Content:

* Title: `Real Sites. Real Results.`

* Subtitle (1–2 lines):

  `Here are a few of the businesses Arclo powers today — from clinics and property managers to farm stays and local services.`

* No huge visual needed; keep it simple and let the grid do the work.

Styling:

* Centered text on desktop.
* `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-extrabold` for heading.
* `text-base md:text-lg text-slate-300/80` for subtitle.

---

### 6. Filter / Tag Row (optional but useful)

* A simple pill-based filter over the grid:

  * `All`, `Healthcare`, `Property Management`, `Hospitality`, etc.
* Clicking a pill filters the grid client-side by `industry` or `tags`.
* Implementation:

  * Local state hook in `Examples.tsx`
  * `selectedFilter` + `projects.filter(...)`

---

### 7. Example Cards Grid

Grid layout:

* 1 column on mobile
* 2 columns on md+
* `gap-8`

Each **Example Card** should include:

* Screenshot or mockup image at top

  * Ratio ~ 16:9
  * `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden shadow-lg`
* Project name + industry
* Short headline (result-oriented):

  * Example: `Booked-out calendar from local search in under 90 days.`
* 2–3 bullet highlights:

  * Example:

    * `Rebuilt site structure around local “psychiatrist near me” intent`
    * `Ongoing content plan with FAQ and condition pages`
    * `Automated weekly SEO checks and fixes`
* Metrics row (if present):

  * Small pill-style stats like:

    * `+84% organic traffic`
    * `Top 3 for “psychiatrist Orlando”`
* “View Site” link:

  * `href={siteUrl}` with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noreferrer"`

Card styling:

* Container:

  * `bg-slate-900/60 border border-slate-800 rounded-3xl p-6 flex flex-col h-full`
* Title:

  * `text-xl font-semibold text-white`
* Industry:

  * `text-sm text-slate-400`
* Highlights:

  * `text-sm text-slate-300 list-disc list-inside mt-3 space-y-1`
* Metrics:

  * Pills: `inline-flex items-center rounded-full bg-slate-800 px-3 py-1 text-xs text-slate-200`

---

### 8. Optional: Detail Modal / Drawer

If time allows, add an optional “View Details” interaction:

* Button: `View case study`
* On click:

  * Open a modal or drawer with:

    * Larger screenshot
    * More detailed before/after metrics
    * A short narrative (“Before Arclo / After Arclo”)
* Use project `id` to fetch details from the same data model.

If time is limited, skip this for v1 and just link out to the live site.

---

### 9. CTA Footer

At the bottom of the page:

* Short CTA:

  `Want your site to look and perform like these?`

* Button row:

  * `Generate My Free Site` (primary)
  * `Talk to Us` or `See How Arclo Works` (secondary)

Layout:

* Centered, `py-12 md:py-16`
* Match button styles from homepage.

---

### 10. Responsiveness & Accessibility

* Ensure cards stack cleanly on mobile.
* Images should use `alt` text: “Screenshot of {name} website.”
* Buttons and links should have proper `aria-label` where needed.
* Keep color contrast high enough over dark backgrounds.

---

### 11. SEO & Routing

* Set page `<title>` and description via existing meta utilities:

  * Title: `Examples | Arclo`
  * Description: `See real sites and real results from businesses using Arclo to automate their websites and SEO.`

* Ensure `/examples` is linked from:

  * Navbar
  * Footer
  * Optionally from the homepage (“See Example Sites” link under hero).

---

This should give a clear, concrete scope: 1 new page, 1 data file, 1 reusable card component, optional filters, and a footer CTA — all aligned with the current Arclo look and feel.
