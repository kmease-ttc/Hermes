Totally get what you’re seeing — that dark theme plus the little seams is fighting the “simple / friendly / polished” vibe you want.

Let me break this into **three concrete fixes** you can hand to your dev:

1. switch to a **light theme**,
2. fix the **spacing** around the mockup + “No effort…” line,
3. fix the **background mismatch/border** around the hero image.

---

## 1. Switch the hero + site to a light design

Ask your dev to move to a **light base with a white hero card**, instead of a full-page dark background.

**Global layout**

* Set the app’s base background to a light gray:

  * `body` / main wrapper bg: `#F3F4F6` (Tailwind `bg-slate-100`).
* Set main text color to dark slate:

  * `text-slate-900` for headings
  * `text-slate-600` for body text.

**Hero section**

Wrap the hero in a white card on that light background:

```tsx
<section className="bg-slate-100">
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 py-16 md:py-24">
    <div className="rounded-3xl bg-white shadow-xl px-8 py-10 md:px-12 md:py-14 flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-10 lg:items-center">
      {/* left: text, right: mockup */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

That gives you: light page, **white hero card**, and everything feels cleaner and more “SaaS but friendly”.

## 2. Fix the weird spacing between the example image & “No effort…” line

Right now it looks like:

* headline / subhead
* buttons
* *then* maybe the reassurance line and mockup spacing are inconsistent, so things feel cramped / random.

Inside the hero card, I’d structure the **left column** like this:

```tsx
<div className="flex-1 space-y-6">
  <p className="inline-flex text-xs font-medium tracking-wide text-indigo-600 uppercase bg-indigo-50 rounded-full px-3 py-1">
    Built for people who don’t want to think about SEO
  </p>

  <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-extrabold text-slate-900 leading-tight">
    Grow Your Business With an AI Website That Runs Itself.
  </h1>

  <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-slate-600 max-w-md">
    Everything your website needs — built, written, fixed, and improved automatically.
  </p>

  {/* CTA row */}
  <div className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4">
    {/* buttons here */}
  </div>

  {/* reassurance line */}
  <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
    No effort. No setup. No SEO knowledge required.
  </p>
</div>
```

Key things:

* Use a **single `space-y-6` stack** so vertical spacing is consistent.
* Put the **reassurance line above the mockup**, not floating alone between elements.
* On the **right column**, start the mockup aligned to the vertical center of the text so there’s a clear separation:

```tsx
<div className="flex-1 flex justify-center lg:justify-end">
  {/* mockup image */}
</div>
```

That will fix the awkward gap between “example” and “No effort…” because the text block is self-contained and the mockup sits beside it, not jammed into it.

## 3. Fix the background color mismatch / border around the hero image

What you’re seeing is:

* The page/section background is one color.
* The **mockup PNG has its own darker background**, so you get a visible edge/border.

You have two ways to fix it — your dev should do at least one of these:

### Option A – Re-export / mask image to be actually transparent

* Open the hero mockup in your editor.
* Make sure the **outer background is transparent**, not a dark gradient.
* Export as PNG with transparency.
* In code:

```tsx
<img
  src="/assets/hero/hero-mockup.png"
  alt="Example local business website generated by Arclo"
  className="w-full max-w-[460px] h-auto drop-shadow-2xl"
 />
```

Since the hero card is white, the mockup will sit cleanly with no visible border.

### Option B – Match the background color in CSS

If you want to keep the existing asset for now:

* Wrap the mockup in a container with the **same background color** as the image’s outer color and hide overflow:

```tsx
<div className="rounded-[32px] bg-[#020617] p-2 shadow-2xl overflow-hidden">
  <img
    src="/assets/hero/hero-mockup.png"
    className="block w-full h-auto"
    alt="Example local business website generated by Arclo"
  />
</div>
```

That way, even if the PNG has a slightly different gradient, the **container matches it**, and the border seam disappears.

## 4. Light-theme polish checklist for your dev

Here’s a quick checklist they can run through while adjusting:

* [ ] Page background is light (`#F3F4F6`), not full dark.
* [ ] Hero content sits on a **white rounded card** with shadow.
* [ ] Headline is dark (`text-slate-900`) and clearly dominant.
* [ ] Subheadline is slightly larger and legible (`text-base`–`text-lg`, medium contrast).
* [ ] CTA buttons use a single primary color (your purple/blue) and stand out on white.
* [ ] Reassurance line sits right under CTAs with ~8–12px spacing.
* [ ] Hero mockup background visually merges with its container (no visible border line).
* [ ] Floating tags still work on light design (probably white tags with subtle gray shadow and indigo text).
* [ ] Below the hero, background color transition is smooth (same light gray as page; no hard cut).

If you want, I can write a full `Home.tsx` hero section in JSX/Tailwind using a light theme so your dev can paste it in and tweak, but these changes alone should fix the spacing + border + “too dark” issues you’re seeing.
