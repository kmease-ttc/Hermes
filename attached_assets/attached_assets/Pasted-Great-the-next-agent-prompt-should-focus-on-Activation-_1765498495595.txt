Great — the next agent prompt should focus on Activation & Onboarding.

Right now you have:
	•	a solid funnel
	•	services + upsells
	•	activity + trust
	•	QA + safety

What you don’t yet have is a system that ensures:
	•	new users understand what to do
	•	they don’t feel overwhelmed
	•	they actually reach “aha” fast
	•	they don’t churn after publish

So the next workstream is:

👉 Activation: Guided Onboarding, Empty States, and Education

This directly impacts conversion, retention, and support load.

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Guided Onboarding & Activation

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement a guided onboarding and education layer that:
	•	helps users complete the right steps in the right order
	•	explains what Arclo is doing for them
	•	reduces confusion around SEO/analytics concepts
	•	increases completion of key activation milestones
	•	lowers early churn

This work should feel calm, helpful, and confidence-building — not salesy.

⸻

PART 1 — Define Activation Milestones (Required)

Create a clear activation model per site.

Activation Milestones

A site is considered “activated” when:
	1.	Site generated
	2.	Site previewed
	3.	Site published
	4.	Domain live
	5.	At least one ongoing service active
	6.	First activity completed successfully

Store:
	•	activation_stage per site
	•	activated_at timestamp when completed

These milestones drive onboarding, nudges, and empty states.

⸻

PART 2 — Guided Onboarding Panel (Critical)

Add an Onboarding Panel to Dashboard

Display a collapsible panel at the top of the site dashboard:

Title:
“Let’s get your site fully live”

Show:
	•	3–5 recommended next steps (not all steps)
	•	Progress indicator
	•	Clear CTA per step

Example steps:
	•	Publish your site
	•	Choose primary services
	•	Connect your domain
	•	Turn on weekly improvements

Each step must link directly to the correct screen.

⸻

PART 3 — Contextual Empty States (High Impact)

Replace all “blank” or passive sections with guided empty states.

Required Empty States
	1.	No active services
Copy:
“Your site is live, but nothing is running yet.”

CTA:
“Turn on weekly improvements”
	2.	No activities yet
Copy:
“Once Arclo starts working on your site, you’ll see updates here.”

CTA:
“Start with Technical SEO”
	3.	No analytics connected
Copy:
“We can’t measure performance yet.”

CTA:
“Have Arclo connect Analytics for you”

⸻

PART 4 — Inline Education (Plain Language Only)

Add “What is this?” Tooltips

For concepts like:
	•	Google Search Console
	•	Analytics
	•	Technical SEO
	•	Structured data
	•	Location pages

Rules:
	•	One sentence max
	•	No jargon
	•	Outcome-focused

Example:
“Technical SEO helps search engines understand and rank your site.”

⸻

PART 5 — First-Week Guidance System

Create a “First 7 Days” Experience

For newly published sites:
	•	Highlight only the most important actions
	•	Defer advanced features
	•	Reduce cognitive load

Show a simple checklist:
	•	Your site is live
	•	We’re optimizing it
	•	Here’s what happens next

Include reassurance copy:
“You don’t need to do everything at once.”

⸻

PART 6 — Onboarding Nudges & Reminders

In-App Nudges

Trigger reminders when:
	•	A required step is skipped for 48+ hours
	•	Site is published but no services active
	•	Analytics not connected after publish

Tone:
Helpful, not urgent.

⸻

Email Nudges (Lightweight)

Send:
	•	“Your site is live — here’s what happens next”
	•	“Arclo made its first improvement”
	•	“Want us to handle setup for you?”

No more than:
	•	1–2 emails in first week

⸻

PART 7 — Admin Controls (Minimal)

Add internal flags:
	•	enable/disable onboarding panel
	•	mark steps as optional/hidden
	•	override activation stage

This allows iteration without redeploys.

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	New users know exactly what to do next
	•	Users reach “site live + service running” faster
	•	Empty states guide action
	•	Confusion around SEO/analytics is reduced
	•	Support questions drop

⸻

Why this is the right next step

You’ve built:
	•	a machine
	•	a service layer
	•	trust and safety

Now you need to ensure users:
	•	understand it
	•	feel guided
	•	don’t bounce

This work turns Arclo into:

“A calm, guided website partner”

instead of:

“A powerful but overwhelming platform.”

⸻

After this, the next two logical workstreams will be:
	1.	Pricing & packaging optimization (conversion)
	2.	Agency / reseller mode (expansion)

When you’re ready, I’ll write either prompt.
