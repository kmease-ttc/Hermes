Here are **clean, developer-ready instructions** you can copy/paste directly to your team.
Clear, concise, and focused on exactly what needs to be built for the **new, premium hero section**.

# **Arclo – Hero Section Redesign Requirements (Developer Instructions)**

## **Goal**

Redesign the homepage hero section so it communicates:

* Premium visual quality
* “Complex made simple”
* Automated website + SEO improvements
* Confidence that Arclo produces beautiful websites
* Strong emotional impact (“fire your SEO agency and web team”)

The final hero must feel **modern, clean, and powerful** — similar to Linear, Notion, Superhuman, or Webflow.

---

## **1. Hero Layout**

The hero should include:

### **A. Headline**

```
Grow Your Business With an AI Website That Runs Itself.
```

### **B. Subheadline**

```
Everything your website needs — built, written, fixed, and improved automatically.
```

*(Copy may evolve, but layout must accommodate short text.)*

### **C. Primary CTA**

```
Generate My Free Site
```

### **D. Secondary CTA (ghost button + arrow)**

```
See It in Action →
```

Spacing should feel airy and premium with large breathing room around the text.

## **2. New Hero Visual (Mandatory)**

Replace the current minimal placeholder with a **premium, confidence-building hero image**.

### **Requirements for the new visual:**

* A **beautiful, modern website mockup** displayed prominently (full-width or large centered card)
* Clean, professional UI styling (rounded corners, subtle shadow, high-end typography)
* **Floating automation labels overlayed around the mockup**, such as:

  * “Content written”
  * “SEO fixed”
  * “Improved today”
  * “Pages generated”
* Subtle AI glow or soft animated accents (optional but preferred)
* Must visually communicate:

  1. The website will look great
  2. Arclo automates everything
  3. The experience is simple and effortless

**Important:**
Do NOT show complex dashboards or charts.
Hero imagery should focus on the **OUTCOME** (a beautiful website), not the tool.

---

## **3. Styling Requirements**

* Large whitespace margins (Apple-style spacing)
* Keep typography clean and oversized, minimal line height
* Make sure the hero image scales responsively
* Ensure the logo blends into the header without visible borders or background artifacts
* Hero section height should visually fill most of the viewport without feeling cramped

---

## **4. Remove or Simplify Below-the-Fold Noise**

The hero section must feel premium on first load.

So:

* Do NOT include secondary icons, checklists, badges, or complex elements immediately beneath the hero
* Keep the reassurance line minimal:

```
No effort. No setup. No SEO knowledge required.
```

---

## **5. Technical Notes**

* The hero image (website mockup + automation tags) can be:

  * A static PNG/SVG designed to look premium
  * OR a component built with HTML/CSS if preferred
* Floating labels can animate gently (fade, float) using CSS or Framer Motion
* Make sure asset is placed under `/client/src/assets/hero/` or another conventional location

---

## **6. Acceptance Criteria**

The hero section is complete when:

1. The page immediately communicates:

   * professionalism
   * automation
   * simplicity
   * confidence

2. The mockup visually looks like a real, beautiful website someone would be proud to have.

3. The automation labels clearly show the “AI does everything” value.

4. There's no visual clutter — large whitespace and premium aesthetics.

5. The logo blends seamlessly into the header with no visible border edge.

6. Responsive design is clean on mobile, tablet, desktop.

If you'd like, I can also generate:

* a Figma reference layout
* the exact HTML/Tailwind structure
* a hero mockup asset your developer can drop in
* animation specs

Just let me know.
