I’d pick Outreach Monks as the first partner to test and integrate because they explicitly offer white-label link building services and an SEO reseller program (i.e., built for agencies to resell).  ￼

Before the instructions, one important product call:

Is “buy backlinks” a good idea for Arclo?

It can be, but only if you position it as “authority building” and enforce quality guardrails. Google’s guidelines discourage manipulative link schemes; the risk is low-quality providers (PBNs/link farms) and “guaranteed DA links.” Your add-on must be manual outreach, real sites, and transparent reporting, and you should be explicit that results vary. Outreach Monks markets “manual, white-hat” outreach and “no PBNs,” which is the right direction for an agency-style reseller.  ￼

Developer instructions: Add a White-Label Backlinks add-on using Outreach Monks

1) What we’re building

Add a new paid add-on in Arclo called something like:

“Authority Boost (Backlinks)”
Plain-language customer benefit: “Get mentioned on other websites so more people (and Google) trust your business.”

This is an optional add-on (not part of the core product). It should plug into the existing “add-ons” UI and billing.

2) Vendor model

We will use Outreach Monks white-label link building as our fulfillment partner. They advertise white-label link building and an SEO reseller program.  ￼

Implementation approach (v1)

Assume no API unless confirmed by Outreach Monks during onboarding. Build v1 as a managed fulfillment workflow:
	•	Arclo collects the order + required inputs
	•	Arclo creates a fulfillment ticket internally
	•	Ops places the order with Outreach Monks via their dashboard/process and uploads the deliverables back into Arclo

If Outreach Monks provides an API later, we can automate order placement.

3) Add-on packaging (keep it simple)

Offer 2–3 options (don’t overcomplicate):
	•	Starter: 2 placements / month
	•	Growth: 4 placements / month
	•	Aggressive: 8 placements / month

Pricing: you decide margin later; implement as configurable in admin/env so you can change without redeploy.

4) Ordering UX requirements (in Arclo)

When a user selects “Authority Boost” in add-ons, collect:
	•	Target website/domain
	•	Business category/industry
	•	Primary service + city (e.g., “auto repair San Marcos”)
	•	Top 3 services
	•	Target URLs (choose automatically if they don’t know: homepage + key service page)
	•	Brand name
	•	Optional: competitor URLs
	•	Optional: “do not use” list (spammy sites they want to avoid)

Add a simple tooltip:
	•	“This helps other websites mention your business, which can improve trust and visibility over time.”

5) Guardrails (must-have to avoid quality disasters)

Disallow:
	•	“Guaranteed rankings”
	•	“DA-only selling”
	•	Anything that sounds like link farms

Require reporting for every placement:
	•	URL where link was placed
	•	Target URL linked to
	•	Anchor text used
	•	Date delivered

Outreach Monks describes manual outreach and reporting as part of their white-label services; ensure our workflow always captures deliverables.  ￼

6) Fulfillment workflow (internal)

Create a new internal object: BacklinkOrder

Status states:
	•	pending_intake
	•	queued
	•	in_progress
	•	delivered
	•	issue

On payment success:
	•	Create BacklinkOrder
	•	Notify ops (Slack/email) with a standardized order summary
	•	Ops submits order to Outreach Monks under reseller/white-label terms

On delivery:
	•	Ops uploads placement report into Arclo
	•	Customer sees results inside Arclo: “Placements delivered this month”

7) Customer-facing dashboard module (simple but powerful)

Add a “Authority Boost” section to the customer dashboard:
	•	“This month: X/Y placements delivered”
	•	Table of placements (URL, date, linked page)
	•	A short plain-language note:
	•	“These mentions can take a few weeks to impact visibility.”

8) Legal/compliance language (keep it short)

Add one non-scary disclaimer to the add-on:
	•	“We use manual outreach to earn placements on real websites. Results vary and can take time.”

Do not mention “buying backlinks” in UI copy. Call it “Authority Boost” or “Mentions” and focus on outcomes.

9) Vendor onboarding checklist (before integration goes live)

Assign someone to confirm with Outreach Monks:
	•	White-label/reseller onboarding requirements  ￼
	•	Turnaround time SLAs
	•	Allowed niches (they list many niches; confirm our target SMB categories are covered)  ￼
	•	Reporting format (CSV/PDF) + cadence
	•	Any automation options (API, webhook, shared dashboard) — if none, keep v1 manual

⸻

Why Outreach Monks (the “why” for your team)
	•	They explicitly market white-label link building services and an SEO reseller program designed for agencies.  ￼
	•	They position their approach as manual outreach and “no PBNs,” which is the minimum bar to reduce risk.  ￼

If you want, I can write the exact add-on card copy (non-technical, SMB-friendly) and the intake form fields in the same style you’ve been using across pricing/results.
