Below is the copy-and-paste–ready instruction set for your developer.
This is the exact specification for fixing the Arclo site builder so that every generated website looks premium, modern, and credible using LuckyThunderPropertyManagement.com as the design benchmark.

No fluff — this is a production-ready implementation brief.

⸻

ARCLŌ WEBSITE GENERATOR – DESIGN & FUNCTIONALITY SPEC (V2)

Goal: produce a premium, modern “best-in-class” website automatically, with a strong hero section, brand-appropriate color system, real imagery, and an optional AI-generated description.

⸻

1. HERO SECTION REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE MUST)

This is the #1 failure point right now.
Every generated site must have a hero that feels like a high-end marketing site (modeled on LuckyThunderPropertyManagement.com).

Dev Implementation:
	•	Full-width hero, minimum 85–100vh height.
	•	Background:
	•	Either an uploaded image,
	•	Or an AI-generated image if none is uploaded.
	•	Overlay gradient for readability (dark-to-transparent).
	•	Typography:
	•	H1 large and bold (48–64px desktop, 32–40px mobile).
	•	Subtitle (AI-generated description).
	•	CTA button styled as modern solid pill (rounded corners, padded).

Button variations:

“Get Started”
“View Services”
“Learn More”

Hero Layout Options (automated):
	•	Option A: Image background + centered text
	•	Option B: Image left, text right
	•	Option C: Text left, image right (desktop only, collapses to stack on mobile)

Automatically select A as default.

⸻

2. COLOR SYSTEM (CURRENT COLORS LOOK BAD = FIX THIS)

The colors right now are harsh (reds, bright greens).
We need a modern, soft, professional palette generated dynamically from the brand name + description.

Dev Requirements:

Use Tailwind or CSS variables to generate a palette with these constraints:

Primary Color (Brand Color)
	•	Muted blues, indigos, teals, or deep purples
	•	Avoid neon, bright primary colors

Secondary Color:
	•	A lighter tint of primary or a complementary cool neutral
	•	Used for accents and button hovers

Neutral Palette:
	•	Grays in the 200–800 range
	•	White backgrounds
	•	Light gray section dividers

Algorithm:
	•	Use OpenAI or Replicate prompt:
“Generate a modern SaaS brand color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutral) based on this company name and description.”

Consistency Rules:
	•	Buttons use primary
	•	Hover uses slightly darker primary
	•	Headings use near-black (#0E0E0E)
	•	Body text = #333 or #444
	•	No pure black (#000)
	•	No pure white text unless on dark overlay

⸻

3. DESCRIPTION FIELD (RE-ADD IT AND MAKE IT AI-ASSISTED)

User Inputs Required:
	•	Business Name
	•	Description (optional)
	•	Images (optional)

If description is blank:

Auto-generate with prompt:

“Write a concise, professional 1–2 sentence description for a business named {BusinessName}. Emphasize what they do and the primary value they provide.”

Where description appears:
	•	Directly under the H1 in the hero
	•	In meta description
	•	In the About section
	•	In internal content blocks (“What we offer”, “Why choose us”, etc.)

This adds credibility and solves the current visual emptiness.

⸻

4. IMAGE HANDLING (CRITICAL FIX)

Right now the generated sites look amateur because there are no images.

User Upload:

Allow upload of:
	•	Hero image
	•	Secondary images (gallery or section backgrounds)

If NO images uploaded: Auto-generate images using business name + description.

AI Image Generation Rules:

Prompt template for hero:
“Create a modern, high-resolution hero image suitable for a professional website in the {industry}. Style: cinematic, clean, natural light, minimalistic, aesthetically pleasing.”

Prompt template for interior sections:
“Generate decorative background images or lifestyle images suitable for a professional website in the {industry}, modern style.”

Image Format Requirements:
	•	WebP preferred
	•	Full-width for hero
	•	16:9 or 21:9 aspect ratio
	•	Compression applied on delivery
	•	Lazy-load below-the-fold images

⸻

5. PAGE STRUCTURE & SECTION TEMPLATES

Ideal structure for ANY small business website (proven by high conversion rates).

Default Layout:
	1.	Hero Section (above the fold)
	2.	Services or “What We Do”
	3.	About Section (uses AI description + supporting copy)
	4.	Image / Text Split Section
	5.	Testimonials (AI placeholder if not provided)
	6.	Contact CTA Section
	7.	Footer

All sections must respect the color palette generated in section 2.

Automatic AI Generation:

If the user provides only a business name, generate placeholder content for:
	•	About
	•	Services
	•	Feature list
	•	Testimonials (generic placeholders, not fake quotes)

This ensures no empty sections.

⸻

6. TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

The typography should look clean, modern, and premium.

Recommended Fonts (automatically applied):

Use Google Fonts:
	•	Headings: Poppins, Inter, or Montserrat
	•	Body: Inter, Roboto, or Lato

Font Rules:
	•	H1: bold, large
	•	H2: semibold
	•	H3: medium
	•	Body: regular
	•	Line height: 1.4–1.6
	•	Max width: 700px for long text

⸻

7. BUTTON AND COMPONENT DESIGN

The current buttons look too basic.

Specifications:
	•	Rounded (8–12px border radius)
	•	Full padding (12–18px vertical, 20–24px horizontal)
	•	High-contrast text
	•	Hover state that darkens primary by 10–15%
	•	Shadow: subtle (0px 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))

⸻

8. RESPONSIVE REQUIREMENTS

Every section must collapse cleanly on mobile.

Mobile Rules:
	•	Hero text centered
	•	Buttons full-width
	•	Images stack under text
	•	Reduce H1 size
	•	Use mobile padding (20–24px)

Tablet Rules:
	•	Two-column sections compress to 50/50 blocks
	•	Typography scale adjusts by 0.85x

⸻

9. OPTIONAL: “Looks-good-or-don’t-publish” Filter

Before rendering a site, run a check:

If:
	•	No images
	•	No description
	•	No services
→ Automatically generate them
→ Do NOT allow a preview without minimum content.

This prevents ugly sites.
