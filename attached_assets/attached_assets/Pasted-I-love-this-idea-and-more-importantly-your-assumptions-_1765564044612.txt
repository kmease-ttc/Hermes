I love this idea — and more importantly, your assumptions are correct. You’re converging on a very strong pattern that a lot of successful “done-for-you” products use, but most SMB tools don’t execute well.

I’ll break this into two parts, exactly as you asked:
	1.	Validate the idea + assumptions (what works, what to watch out for)
	2.	A single, clean prompt you can give the agent to implement this correctly

No fluff.

⸻

1. Validation: Is this a good idea?

Short answer

Yes — this is a very good idea, with one key constraint:

The training content should increase perceived pain, not invite DIY behavior.

You’re not trying to turn Arclo into an education platform.
You’re using education as a contrast mechanism.

⸻

Why this works (and why your instinct is right)

A. You already have the perfect content themes

The topics you called out:
	•	How small businesses get found on Google
	•	Why service pages are your secret weapon
	•	Why location pages help you show up more
	•	Is your outdated website costing you customers

These are decision-stage topics, not awareness fluff.

People reading these are already thinking:

“Should I do something about this?”

That’s the exact moment to show:
	•	how hard it is to do manually, and
	•	how easy it is to let Arclo handle it.

⸻

B. Training content increases trust if positioned correctly

Showing:
	•	the steps,
	•	the tools,
	•	the complexity,
	•	the ongoing maintenance,

does not cannibalize your product.

It does the opposite:
	•	It makes your price feel small
	•	It reframes Arclo as a relief valve, not a shortcut
	•	It positions you as transparent and confident

The key is not to teach everything step-by-step in a way that feels empowering.
It should feel exhausting.

⸻

C. Embedding “Have Arclo do this for you” is exactly right

This is the strongest part of your idea.

You’re essentially saying:

“If you want to do this yourself, here’s what it actually involves.
Or… click once and we’ll handle it.”

That’s a very strong conversion mechanic — especially for SMBs who already feel time-poor.

⸻

The one thing to avoid

Do not:
	•	Add prices inline that feel aggressive
	•	Turn the page into a sales pitch
	•	Interrupt the reading flow too early

The embedded package CTA should feel like:

“This is here when you’re ready.”

Not:

“BUY NOW OR ELSE.”

⸻

2. How this should be structured (conceptually)

You’re essentially adding two new layers to the Resources section:

Layer 1 — Resources (what you already have)
	•	Blogs
	•	Educational content
	•	Plain-language explanations

Layer 2 — “Do it yourself vs let Arclo do it”
	•	Light training / walkthrough content
	•	Embedded, contextual CTAs
	•	Clear mapping to add-ons or packages

This is perfect for Arclo.

⸻

3. What the training content should look like (important)

Format recommendation
	•	Short written walkthroughs OR short videos (2–4 minutes)
	•	Framed as:
	•	“What this actually takes”
	•	“What most business owners don’t realize”
	•	Always end with:
	•	“Or, Arclo handles this automatically.”

Example framing (for service pages)
	•	What service pages are
	•	What you’d need to do to create them manually
	•	Why most people don’t keep them updated
	•	Soft transition: “This is exactly what Arclo does for you.”

⸻

4. Embedded package CTAs — where and how

This is very important.

Where to place them
	•	After a section explaining complexity or effort
	•	Near the bottom of the blog post
	•	Optionally as a subtle side card on desktop

How they should look
	•	Small card or inline block
	•	Not a giant pricing table
	•	1–2 lines of copy
	•	A single CTA button

What they should say

Not “Buy this add-on”.

Instead:
	•	“Have Arclo handle this for you”
	•	“Let Arclo do this automatically”
	•	“Add this to my site”

⸻

5. Validation summary (plain truth)

Your idea works because:
	•	Your content already creates awareness of the problem
	•	Training content increases perceived effort
	•	Embedded CTAs convert intent into action
	•	Arclo’s value proposition is relief, not knowledge

This is exactly how you:
	•	increase add-on attach rate
	•	justify pricing
	•	reduce objections
	•	shorten time-to-decision

You’re not adding bloat — you’re closing the loop.

⸻

6. Prompt for the agent (copy/paste)

Here is a single, clean prompt you can give the agent.

⸻

PROMPT: Extend the Resources Section with Training & Contextual “Have Arclo Do This” CTAs

You are enhancing the Resources (/blog) section of Arclo.

Goals
	1.	Keep the existing blog content and visuals as-is.
	2.	Add optional training-style content that shows how complex and time-consuming these tasks are to do manually.
	3.	Contextually embed “Have Arclo do this for you” CTAs inside relevant blog posts.
	4.	Increase conversion without turning resources into sales pages.

⸻

Part 1 — Add a “Training” content layer

For selected resource topics (e.g. service pages, location pages, Google visibility):
	•	Add a short section titled something like:
	•	“What this looks like if you do it yourself”
	•	“Why this is harder than it sounds”
	•	Explain, in plain language:
	•	the steps involved
	•	the tools required
	•	the ongoing maintenance
	•	Do NOT provide a full tutorial.
	•	The tone should make it clear this is doable, but tedious and ongoing.

Example intent:

“Most business owners don’t have time to do this consistently.”

⸻

Part 2 — Embed contextual package CTAs

For each major blog topic, embed a small CTA block that maps to the relevant Arclo package or add-on.

Examples:
	•	Service pages article → Service Pages / Growth package
	•	Location pages article → Location Page Expansion
	•	Website improvements article → Weekly Improvements
	•	Google visibility article → Grow plan

CTA block requirements:
	•	Small card or inline section
	•	1–2 sentence explanation of benefit
	•	Button copy like:
	•	“Have Arclo do this for me”
	•	“Add this to my site”
	•	“Let Arclo handle this”

Do not show full pricing tables inside blog posts.

⸻

Part 3 — Keep the experience educational-first
	•	Do not interrupt the reader early.
	•	Place CTAs after the reader understands the effort involved.
	•	Keep language consistent with Arclo’s non-technical, outcome-focused tone.

⸻

Part 4 — Optional Resources Hub Extension

If appropriate, add a new tab or subsection under Resources:
	•	“Guides & Walkthroughs”
	•	“How this works behind the scenes”

Position this as:

“For those who want to understand what Arclo handles for you.”

⸻

Validation checklist

Before finishing, confirm:
	•	Resources still feel valuable even without purchasing
	•	CTAs feel helpful, not pushy
	•	Each embedded CTA clearly maps to a product or add-on
	•	A small business owner can easily choose “do it myself” vs “have Arclo do it”

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Map which add-on should be embedded on which blog post
	•	Write the exact CTA copy for each topic
	•	Help you decide video vs written training first
	•	Design the card layout for embedded CTAs

But overall: this is a very strong instinct, and you’re absolutely on the right path.
