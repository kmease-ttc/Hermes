Nice, this page is already a strong concept. Let’s turn it into the “product explainer” that matches the new home style and feels as premium as the hero.

I’ll break it into three things you can hand straight to your dev:

1. Layout & design tweaks
2. Copy structure for each accordion item
3. Concrete implementation instructions

---

## 1. Layout & Design Tweaks

### Hero block (“The Complete Engine”)

Keep the overall structure, but align it to the home style:

* Wrap in the shared `Section` component (`variant="light"`).

* Use:

  * Overline: `Overline>What We Do</Overline>`
  * Title: `SectionTitle>The Complete Engine</SectionTitle>`
  * Subtitle: one tighter sentence:

    > We don’t just build websites. We build autonomous growth machines. Here’s everything Arclo does for you automatically.

* Add a subtle AI-glow behind the accordion card stack:

```tsx
<div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-x-0 top-32 h-64 bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_center,_rgba(79,70,229,0.12),_transparent_70%)] opacity-70 blur-2xl" />
```

### Accordion card stack

Right now it’s functional but a little “admin-y”. Make each accordion row feel like a premium module:

* Wrap the whole accordion in a `Card`:

```tsx
<Card className="relative mt-10 divide-y divide-slate-100">
  {/* accordion items */}
</Card>
```

* Accordion header row style:

```tsx
<button
  className="
    w-full flex items-center justify-between
    px-6 py-5 md:px-8 md:py-6
    text-left
    hover:bg-slate-50/80
    transition-colors
  "
>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <span className="inline-flex h-7 w-7 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-indigo-50 text-[11px] font-semibold text-indigo-600">
      A
    </span>
    <div>
      <p className="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Website Generation
      </p>
      <p className="mt-0.5 text-xs text-slate-500">
        Beautiful, conversion-ready sites built in seconds.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ChevronIcon className="h-4 w-4 text-slate-400 transition-transform data-[open=true]:rotate-180" />
</button>
```

* Expanded panel body:

```tsx
<div className="px-6 pb-5 md:px-8 md:pb-6 text-sm text-slate-600 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-[minmax(0,1.4fr)_minmax(0,1fr)]">
  <ul className="space-y-2">
    {/* bullets */}
  </ul>
  <div className="rounded-2xl bg-slate-50 border border-slate-100 p-4 text-xs text-slate-500">
    {/* mini visual or “At a glance” summary */}
  </div>
</div>
```

The “ready to automate all of this?” banner already fits your new style; just make sure it uses the shared `Card` + `primary Button` components.

## 2. Suggested Copy for Each Accordion Item

You can tweak the wording, but this gives you a solid starting point that leans into “done-for-you automation.”

**Short subtext (in header):**
“Your entire site, generated in seconds.”

**Body bullets:**

* Full multi-page site built from your business name, niche, and location
* Modern layout, responsive on desktop and mobile
* Clear calls-to-action and lead capture baked in
* Local SEO structure (home, services, location pages) generated automatically

**At a glance box:**
“Time to first live site: usually under 5 minutes.”

---

### B. Keyword Intelligence & Content Strategy

**Subtext:**
“Your keyword universe, mapped automatically.”

**Bullets:**

* Keyword discovery based on real search data for your city and services
* Grouped into clusters for services, location, FAQs, and blog topics

* Optional new content pushes scheduled automatically

**At a glance:**
“A weekly rhythm of improvements, like having an SEO team run sprints for you.”

---

### F. Image Intelligence

**Subtext:**
“Smart images that load fast and rank better.”

**Bullets:**

* Automatic image compression and next-gen formats where supported
* Alt text generated based on page content and keywords

## 3. Dev Instructions for This Page

You can give your developer this block:

1. **Wrap `/what-we-do` in the global `AppLayout` and use the `Section` component** for:

   * Hero (The Complete Engine) – `variant="light"`
   * Accordion section (same section, below hero text)
   * CTA banner (use `Card` + primary/secondary buttons)

2. **Replace any ad hoc typography with shared components**:

   * `<Overline>What We Do</Overline>`
   * `<SectionTitle>The Complete Engine</SectionTitle>`
   * `<SectionSubtitle>…</SectionSubtitle>`

3. **Refactor the accordion into a reusable `EngineAccordion` component**:

   * Use a `Card` wrapper for the whole stack.
   * Each item uses:

     * Letter badge (A–F) chip on the left.
     * Title + one-line subtext in the header.
     * Expand/collapse chevron icon on the right.
   * Use your existing accordion logic (or Headless UI) but apply the new classes.

4. **Implement the two-column expanded body**:

   * Left: `<ul>` of bullets using the copy above.
   * Right: a neutral info panel saying “At a glance” with one short stat or phrase.
   * On mobile, stack these columns (grid → `grid-cols-1`).

5. **Update the “Ready to automate all of this?” banner**:

   * Use the shared `Card` primitive.
   * Center text and CTA.
   * Use the `primary` gradient button pattern already used in the hero.

6. **Ensure consistency with the design system**:

   * No raw hex colors; use theme tokens.
   * Same radii (`rounded-3xl`) and shadows (`shadow-soft` or `shadow-hero`) as the home page.
   * Same button component, focus states, and hover interactions as elsewhere.

If you’d like, next step I can help you write the actual bullet content for each accordion item in JSX so the dev can copy-paste it into the component.
