You’re in a good launch posture already. At this point, the biggest risk isn’t missing a feature — it’s missing a few high-leverage, low-effort web tweaks that materially improve conversion, trust, and post-launch learning.

Below is a pre-launch web checklist, ordered by impact. None of this requires re-architecture, and all of it pays off immediately once traffic hits.

⸻

1. One Clear “What Happens Next” Path (Very High Impact)

Right now Arclo does a lot, but first-time visitors still have a small mental gap:

“If I click this, what actually happens?”

Recommendation

Add a very short 3-step explainer near primary CTAs (homepage + pricing).

Example (copy, not design-heavy):

How Arclo Works
	1.	Tell us about your business
	2.	We build and improve your website automatically
	3.	More customers find and contact you

This reduces hesitation and increases click-through without adding clutter.

⸻

2. Explicit “No Lock-In / No Risk” Trust Signals (High Impact)

You do have this implicitly, but it should be explicit.

Add one short line near pricing CTAs:
	•	“No contracts. Cancel anytime.”
	•	“You can preview your site before paying.”
	•	“No technical setup required.”

These matter disproportionately for small business owners who’ve been burned before.

⸻

3. Social Proof (Even Light / Early Is Fine)

You don’t need big logos yet — but you do need something that signals “other people are using this.”

Low-effort options (pick 1–2):
	•	“Built for local businesses like HVAC, plumbing, bakeries, and more”
	•	“Used by early customers across Texas” (or wherever is true)
	•	Short anonymized testimonial style copy:
	•	“I didn’t want to think about my website anymore — Arclo handles it.”

This can be text-only for launch.

⸻

4. Add a Simple FAQ Section (Huge Objection Killer)

This is one of the highest ROI additions you can make before launch.

4–6 questions max, plain language:
	•	Do I need to understand SEO?
	•	Do I need to update my website myself?
	•	Can I use my existing domain?
	•	What if I already have a website?
	•	How long until my site is live?
	•	Can I cancel anytime?

You’ve answered all of these in product logic — just surface them.

⸻

5. Pricing Page: One Small Clarification (You’re Almost There)

Your pricing page is strong. One thing I’d add:

Under the main plan price:

A single clarifying line like:

Designed for businesses that want more customers without managing their website or marketing.

This helps anchor who it’s for and reduces “is this overkill for me?” thoughts.

You do not need more plans or complexity.

⸻

6. Email Capture / Follow-Up Safety Net

Before launch traffic arrives, make sure you don’t lose people who hesitate.

Recommendation
	•	If someone starts but doesn’t finish onboarding, ensure:
	•	Email capture happens early
	•	A simple follow-up email exists:
	•	“Your site preview is ready”
	•	“Want to finish setting up your site?”

Even one basic email is enough for launch.

⸻

7. Analytics & Feedback Hooks (Critical for Week 1–2)

Before launch, double-check:
	•	You can answer:
	•	Where people drop off
	•	Which CTAs they click
	•	Which plans they hover/select
	•	Add a tiny feedback link somewhere:
	•	“Something confusing?” or “Give feedback”

You’ll learn more from 5 real users than weeks of internal testing.

⸻

8. Performance & First Impression Check (Quick but Important)

Do one last pass on:
	•	Mobile layout (especially CTAs above the fold)
	•	Page load speed on homepage + pricing
	•	Button clarity (“Generate My Free Site” still feels right — good)

Nothing fancy — just make sure nothing obviously breaks trust.

⸻

9. What NOT to Add Before Launch (Important)

Avoid:
	•	More add-ons
	•	More configuration options
	•	More technical explanations
	•	More pages “just because”

You’ve already made the right call keeping things simple.

⸻

TL;DR — Pre-Launch Web Updates Worth Doing Now

If you do nothing else, do these 5:
	1.	Add a 3-step “How it works” explainer
	2.	Add explicit no-risk messaging (cancel anytime, preview first)
	3.	Add light social proof (even text-only)
	4.	Add a small FAQ section
	5.	Ensure basic analytics + email follow-up are live

Everything else can come after real users touch it.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a launch-day checklist
	•	Write the exact FAQ copy
	•	Review the homepage line by line as a final conversion pass
	•	Help you decide what to measure in week 1 vs week 4

Just tell me where you want to go next.
