Here is a clean, single simulated cold-user walkthrough prompt you can give directly to an agent.

This is designed to surface doubt, confusion, friction, and trust breaks — not feature ideas.

SIMULATED COLD-USER WALKTHROUGH

Agent Prompt

Objective

Simulate the experience of a first-time, non-technical small business owner encountering Arclo for the first time.

Your job is to walk through the product step by step as this user and identify:
	•	moments of confusion
	•	hesitation
	•	mistrust
	•	friction
	•	unanswered questions
	•	points where you would abandon or delay

This is not a usability test and not a design critique.
This is a psychological and functional walkthrough.

⸻

User Persona (Important)

Assume the user is:
	•	A small business owner (HVAC, plumbing, funding, services)
	•	Non-technical
	•	Possibly has no website today
	•	Slightly skeptical of “AI tools”
	•	Willing to pay if it feels safe and easy
	•	Afraid of breaking something or making a bad decision

They are not a power user and not a founder.

⸻

Walkthrough Instructions

Walk through Arclo in this exact order:
	1.	Landing page (first impression)
	2.	“Generate Free Site” action
	3.	Site generation form
	4.	Site preview experience
	5.	“Publish My Site” moment
	6.	Account creation
	7.	Launch checklist
	8.	Domain decision
	9.	Checkout & pricing
	10.	Post-publish dashboard
	11.	Customization & updates understanding
	12.	Ongoing value perception

At each step, pause and answer the questions below.

⸻

Questions to Answer at Every Step

For each step, explicitly answer:
	1.	What do I think is happening right now?
	2.	What am I worried about at this moment?
	3.	What question do I have that is not answered?
	4.	Do I trust this enough to continue? Why or why not?
	5.	Would a cautious business owner hesitate here?
	6.	What would make this feel safer or clearer?

Do not assume knowledge.
Do not fill in gaps yourself.
If something is unclear, say so.

⸻

What to Look For (Critical)

Pay special attention to:
	•	unclear ownership (domain, site, data)
	•	fear of being locked in
	•	fear of hidden costs
	•	fear of complexity later
	•	fear of “this is just a demo”
	•	moments where the product feels too quiet
	•	moments where the product feels too pushy

⸻

Output Format (Strict)

Produce the walkthrough as a numbered sequence, one section per step.

For each step include:

Step X: [Name of Step]
	•	What I understand
	•	What worries me
	•	What’s unclear or missing
	•	Confidence level (High / Medium / Low)
	•	Abandonment risk (None / Low / Medium / High)
	•	One concrete improvement suggestion (only one)

Do not redesign the product.
Do not suggest new features unless absolutely required.
Focus on clarity, reassurance, and flow.

⸻

Tone Rules
	•	Be brutally honest
	•	Assume skepticism
	•	Assume distraction
	•	Assume limited patience
	•	Optimize for trust, not cleverness

⸻

Definition of Done

A successful walkthrough:
	•	Identifies where doubt first appears
	•	Surfaces hidden assumptions in the product
	•	Clearly explains why a user might hesitate
	•	Produces actionable insights without feature creep

⸻

Why This Matters

This walkthrough answers the real question:

“If I send a stranger here with money on the line, where do they get nervous?”

That is the final gate before prime time.

⸻

If you want, after you get the walkthrough results, paste them here and I’ll:
	•	triage the issues
	•	separate perception vs real gaps
	•	tell you exactly what to fix first and what to ignore
