The next highest-leverage thing to work on is:

👉 Lifecycle + Trust: “Show me what you did and why it matters”

Right now, you’re building a powerful machine, but users will still churn if they don’t see value accumulating and trust that things are actually happening.

You already have the beginnings of this with “What’s Next” and “Recently Completed” — the next step is to formalize this into a real activity + notification system that:
	•	reinforces value
	•	reduces support questions
	•	drives upsells naturally
	•	makes Arclo feel like a managed service, not a tool

This should come before deeper SEO features, more automations, or agency workflows.

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Activity, Notifications, and Trust Layer

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement a unified Activity + Notification system that shows:
	•	what Arclo is doing
	•	what changed on the site
	•	what value it created
	•	what’s coming next
	•	when the user should care

This system must power:
	•	“Recently Completed”
	•	“What’s Next”
	•	Email notifications
	•	In-app notifications
	•	Upsell triggers

⸻

PART 1 — Formalize the Activity Model (Required)

Create an activities table

Fields:
	•	id
	•	site_id
	•	service_key
	•	activity_type (setup | seo | content | performance | visibility | system)
	•	title
	•	description
	•	impact_summary (plain language outcome)
	•	status (scheduled | running | completed | failed)
	•	started_at
	•	completed_at
	•	metadata (json)
	•	visible_to_user (bool)

Rules
	•	Every automated or manual action must create an activity
	•	Activities power UI, email, and notifications
	•	No “silent work”

⸻

PART 2 — Upgrade “Recently Completed” (Required)

Replace static cards with activity-driven feed

Each completed activity card must show:
	•	What was done
	•	Why it matters
	•	When it happened
	•	Optional “Learn more” expandable detail

Example:
“Published new location page for San Marcos”
Impact: “Helps your business appear in more local searches”

Design requirements
	•	Strong contrast
	•	Consistent icons
	•	Matches Arclo visual language (purple accent, clean cards)

⸻

PART 3 — Upgrade “What’s Next” into a Timeline

Change from list → timeline / queue

Each upcoming activity shows:
	•	Service responsible
	•	Scheduled timing (“Next week”, “In 3 days”)
	•	Whether it’s included or locked

Locked items must show:
	•	“Available with Blog Automation”
	•	CTA: Subscribe

⸻

PART 4 — Add Notification System (Critical)

In-App Notifications

Create a notification bell with:
	•	New completed activities
	•	Setup tasks requiring user input
	•	Domain / DNS status updates
	•	Publishing confirmation

Email Notifications (Phase 1)

Send emails for:
	•	Site published
	•	Setup completed (GSC / GA)
	•	Weekly “Here’s what Arclo did for you”
	•	Monthly summary

Emails must:
	•	Be plain-language
	•	Show concrete actions
	•	Reinforce value
	•	Link back to dashboard

⸻

PART 5 — Weekly Value Summary (Big Retention Win)

Create a weekly digest job

Once per week per site:
	•	Aggregate completed activities
	•	Generate a summary:
	•	“3 improvements made”
	•	“2 new pages published”
	•	“Performance optimized”

Display this:
	•	In dashboard
	•	Via email

This summary should implicitly upsell by showing:
	•	what’s active
	•	what’s missing
	•	what could be added

⸻

PART 6 — Tie Activities to Upsells (Important)

Rules:
	•	If an activity is from an inactive service:
	•	show it as “Available”
	•	add CTA
	•	If a user clicks “Subscribe”:
	•	unlock future activities immediately
	•	show them appear in “What’s Next”

This makes upsells feel like turning on value, not buying features.

⸻

PART 7 — Admin / Internal View (Lightweight)

Add an internal admin view:
	•	filter activities by site
	•	mark manual activities complete
	•	add internal notes
	•	retry failed activities

This supports early-stage manual execution without breaking UX.

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Every action produces an activity
	•	Dashboard clearly shows progress and value
	•	Users receive clear signals that Arclo is working
	•	Upsells are naturally embedded
	•	Support questions decrease

⸻

Why this is the right next step
	•	You already have generation
	•	You already have services
	•	You already have pricing
	•	What you don’t yet have is confidence + momentum

This layer turns Arclo from:

“Cool AI site builder”

into:

“My website team that works every week”

⸻

If you want, after this we should do either:
	1.	Pricing page + packaging rewrite (conversion), or
	2.	QA + Playwright automation tied to activities (quality at scale)

Say which one you want next and I’ll write that prompt.
