You’re right — this UI is confusing, internally inconsistent, and violates several basic UX principles, especially for a “prime-time” onboarding moment.

Below are clear, copy-pasteable instructions you can hand directly to your developer. This is not a redesign fantasy; it’s a fix plan grounded in best practices and aligned with the rest of your product.

Instructions: Fix the “Day 1 of 7 / Today’s Focus” UI

High-Level Diagnosis (for context)

This component fails because it:
	•	mixes time-based onboarding with task-based onboarding
	•	hides critical actions behind “future days”
	•	introduces artificial gating (“Unlocks Day 2”) that makes users feel blocked
	•	uses visual styles that don’t match the rest of the dashboard
	•	competes with the actual primary actions already on the page

Result: confusion, hesitation, and distrust.

This is especially bad for non-technical SMB users.

What This Section Should Be

This section should answer one question only:

“What should I do next, right now, to get my site live and valuable?”

Not:
	•	a course
	•	a schedule
	•	a drip program
	•	a tutorial

⸻

Core Changes (Must Do)

1. Delete the “Day 1 of 7” Concept Entirely

Remove:
	•	“Day 1 of 7”
	•	“Unlocks Day 2”
	•	“View full schedule”
	•	Any time-based gating

Reason:
Time-based onboarding makes users feel controlled and confused. Task-based onboarding gives agency and clarity.

⸻

2. Replace With a Simple “Next Steps” Card

Rename the section to:

“Next steps to get your site live”

Subtext:
“Complete these when you’re ready. You can come back anytime.”

No days. No countdowns. No unlocks.

⸻

3. Use the Same Visual Language as the Rest of the Dashboard

Styling rules:
	•	White or neutral card background (match other cards)
	•	Same border radius
	•	Same shadow depth
	•	Same typography scale
	•	Same primary button style (purple)

Do not introduce new colors (e.g., orange CTA here but purple elsewhere).

⸻

4. Flatten the Content Into Actionable Tasks

Replace the current structure with 3–5 clear tasks, each with:
	•	icon
	•	title
	•	one-line explanation
	•	single CTA

Example structure:

Review your site
“Check your AI-generated website and request changes if needed.”
[View Preview]

Publish your site
“Make your site live so customers can find you.”
[Publish]

Connect a domain
“Use your own domain name for a professional look.”
[Connect domain]

Optional: Improve visibility
“Connect Google tools so we can track and improve performance.”
[Have Arclo do this]

⸻

5. Remove Duplicate CTAs

Right now you have:
	•	“View Preview” in this card
	•	“Preview” buttons on site cards
	•	A notification banner with another CTA

Rules:
	•	Each primary action should appear once per screen
	•	If the site is “Preview Ready,” rely on the site card CTA
	•	The onboarding card should guide, not duplicate

If “View Preview” already exists below → remove it here.

⸻

6. Kill the Notification Banner at the Bottom

This banner:

“Your site is ready! Take a look…”

Should be:
	•	Either removed entirely
	•	Or shown once, dismissible forever

Never show it persistently once preview has been viewed.

Persistent banners signal broken state or nagging.

⸻

7. Align Copy With Your “Managed Service” Positioning

Avoid language that implies:
	•	the user must do everything
	•	the user must understand steps
	•	the user must follow a program

Replace with:
	•	“We’ll handle this for you”
	•	“You can do this now or later”
	•	“Nothing breaks if you skip”

Example improvement:

Instead of:

“Check out your AI-generated website and make sure everything looks right.”

Use:

“Review your site. If you want changes, just tell us and we’ll handle them.”

⸻

8. Tie This Section to Real State (Not Time)

Each task should:
	•	show completed / not completed
	•	reflect actual system state
	•	disappear once done

No fake progress bars.

Progress should be:
	•	task-based
	•	honest
	•	reversible

⸻

What to Remove Entirely

Tell the developer to delete, not refactor:
	•	“Day X of Y”
	•	“Unlocks Day X”
	•	“View full schedule”
	•	Any time-based sequencing
	•	Any onboarding logic not tied to real system state

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (for You)

This section is fixed when:
	•	A cold user immediately understands what to do next
	•	Nothing feels blocked or delayed
	•	The UI visually matches the rest of the dashboard
	•	There is exactly one clear primary action
	•	Users feel in control, not trained

If you wouldn’t explain this section verbally to a friend, it’s still wrong.

⸻

One-Line Guidance for the Developer

“Replace the time-based onboarding (‘Day 1 of 7’) with a simple, task-based ‘Next steps’ card that uses the same styling as the rest of the dashboard, removes artificial gating, and focuses on immediate actions that get the site live.”

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	sketch the exact component structure (props, states, conditions), or
	•	do a full cold-user critique of the entire dashboard layout

Just say which.
