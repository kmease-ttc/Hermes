Perfect. The next prompt should now focus on Growth Loops & Referrals.

At this point you have:
	•	a working product
	•	proof of customization
	•	ongoing value
	•	confidence + trust

The next unlock is organic growth, where customers help sell Arclo for you.

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Referral, Sharing & Growth Loop

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement a lightweight referral and sharing system that allows Arclo customers to:
	•	easily share their site
	•	show off before/after improvements
	•	refer other businesses
	•	generate inbound demand organically

This must feel natural, not like affiliate marketing.

⸻

PART 1 — “Share My Site” (Low Friction)

Add a Share Action in the Dashboard

Add a button:
“Share my site”

When clicked, present options:
	•	Copy site URL
	•	Share before/after view
	•	Share “Built with Arclo” link (optional)

Do NOT force branding.
Do NOT add watermarks by default.

⸻

PART 2 — Before/After Sharing Links

Generate Shareable Links

For each before/after pair:
	•	Generate a public, read-only link
	•	Show:
	•	transformation
	•	short explanation
	•	“Powered by Arclo” footer (subtle)

Purpose:
	•	Let customers visually prove improvement to peers
	•	Create curiosity-driven traffic

⸻

PART 3 — Simple Referral Flow (Phase 1)

Referral Entry Point

Add a section in the dashboard:
“Refer another business”

Flow:
	1.	Enter name + email of referred business (optional)
	2.	OR copy referral link

No dashboards.
No points.
No gamification yet.

⸻

Referral Incentive (Keep It Simple)

Incentive:
	•	$50 account credit OR
	•	One free month of an add-on

Apply credit only when:
	•	Referred site is generated
	•	Referred user publishes + pays

⸻

PART 4 — Referral Tracking (Backend)

Create a referrals table:
	•	id
	•	referrer_user_id
	•	referred_email (nullable)
	•	referral_code
	•	status (sent | site_created | converted)
	•	created_at
	•	converted_at

Tie referral_code to:
	•	site generation
	•	account creation

⸻

PART 5 — Landing Page Support

Add “Built with Arclo” Pattern (Optional)

Allow users to optionally enable:
	•	small footer text:
“Built with Arclo”

Toggle:
	•	off by default
	•	incentivized (e.g., referral credit)

This creates passive growth without force.

⸻

PART 6 — Admin Controls

Internal admin view:
	•	see referrals
	•	approve credits
	•	disable abuse
	•	view conversion rates

⸻

PART 7 — Guardrails
	•	No aggressive referral prompts
	•	No spammy email behavior
	•	No forced branding
	•	No MLM vibes

Tone:
Helpful, proud, optional.

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Users can share their site easily
	•	Before/after examples travel outside Arclo
	•	Referrals are trackable
	•	Credits are applied cleanly
	•	Growth loop exists without friction

⸻

Why This Is the Right Next Step

You’ve already created something people will want to show.

This system:
	•	turns pride into growth
	•	turns results into marketing
	•	scales without ad spend

⸻

After this, the next logical workstreams are:
	1.	Arclo’s own SEO & example-driven landing pages
	2.	White-label / reseller mode
	3.	API & integrations (Zapier, CRM, etc.)

When ready, tell me which one and I’ll write the next prompt.
