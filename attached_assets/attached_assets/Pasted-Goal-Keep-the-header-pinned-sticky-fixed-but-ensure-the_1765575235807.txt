Goal

Keep the header pinned (sticky/fixed), but ensure the page content always starts below it. No overlap. No hidden text/buttons.

⸻

What to change

1) Decide one approach and use it everywhere

Pick either:

Option A (recommended): Sticky header
	•	Header stays in normal document flow.
	•	Uses position: sticky; top: 0;
	•	This usually avoids overlap problems automatically.

Option B: Fixed header
	•	Header uses position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
	•	Requires adding a top offset to the page content.

If you already have fixed, it’s fine — just do the offset correctly.

⸻

2) If using a fixed header, add a global top offset

Requirement

All pages must have a consistent offset equal to the header height.

Implementation rules:
	•	Define a single header height variable (desktop + mobile if different).
	•	Apply it to the main page container:
	•	padding-top: HEADER_HEIGHT;
	•	Do this once at the layout level, not per-page hacks.

Must be responsive

If header is taller on mobile, the padding must match the mobile height too.

⸻

3) Don’t guess header height—measure it

If header height can change (responsive nav, banners, etc.), don’t hardcode.

Requirement:
	•	On load and on resize, measure the header’s actual rendered height.
	•	Set a CSS variable like --header-h to that number.
	•	Use padding-top: var(--header-h) on the main content wrapper.

This prevents overlap forever, even if you tweak the header later.

⸻

4) Specific QA checks

After implementation, verify on:
	•	Desktop + mobile widths
	•	Results/Preview page (where it currently overlaps)
	•	Pricing page
	•	Dashboard

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The stepper (“Scan / Preview / Customize / Publish”) is fully visible without being hidden by the header.
	•	The top of the preview cards is visible.
	•	No content is obscured when the page loads at scroll position 0.
	•	Scrolling does not cause layout jumps.

PROMPT: Fix Header Overlap While Keeping It Pinned

We need the header to remain pinned, but it currently overlaps/blocks the top of the page content (especially on Results/Preview pages). Fix this globally.

Requirements:
	1.	Keep the header pinned (sticky or fixed is fine).
	2.	Ensure page content never sits underneath the header.
	3.	Implement a global solution (layout-level), not page-specific hacks.
	4.	If using a fixed header, add a top padding/margin to the main content wrapper equal to the actual header height.
	5.	Header height must be responsive; measure it and store it in a CSS variable (e.g., –header-h), then apply padding-top: var(–header-h).
	6.	Verify on desktop and mobile that the stepper and top-of-page content are fully visible with no overlap.

Deliver:
	•	Summary of what was causing overlap
	•	Confirmation that Results/Preview page no longer has content hidden under the header
