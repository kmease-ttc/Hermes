	1.	Replace the existing “trusted by” strip

	•	In the marketing site repo (/marketing-site), find the component/section that currently renders:
	•	Heading text similar to:
TRUSTED BY BUSINESSES POWERED BY TEAMS FROM
	•	Logos/text for: Amazon, MicroStrategy, Google, Shopify, Stripe.
	•	Remove that heading and logo list entirely.
	•	We will replace it with a “powered by technology” strip.

	2.	New copy and structure

Use this exact text and ordering:
	•	Heading (all caps style can be done via CSS):
POWERED BY INDUSTRY-LEADING AI & INFRASTRUCTURE
	•	Logo/text row (in this order):
OpenAI   •   SendGrid   •   Stripe   •   Cloudflare   •   AWS

If you’re using logos instead of plain text, map them 1:1 to those names.

	3.	Layout requirements

	•	Section should be visually similar to the old one:
	•	Full-width, centered content.
	•	Plenty of whitespace above/below (e.g. 64–96px padding).
	•	Heading in muted uppercase, small letter-spacing.
	•	Logos/text in a single horizontal row on desktop, wrapping or stacking on mobile.
	•	On mobile:
	•	Center-align everything.
	•	Allow the logo row to wrap to 2–3 lines with even spacing.
	•	Colors:
	•	Heading: muted slate/gray matching the rest of the site’s secondary text.
	•	Logos/text: slightly darker gray (same as previous trust strip), not full black.

	4.	Example JSX (if the marketing site is React + Tailwind)

// components/TechStackStrip.tsx
export function TechStackStrip() {
  return (
    <section className="w-full py-16 bg-white">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl text-center px-4">
        <p className="text-xs font-semibold tracking-[0.2em] text-slate-400 uppercase">
          Powered by industry-leading AI &amp; infrastructure
        </p>

        <div className="mt-8 flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-x-12 gap-y-4 text-sm font-medium text-slate-500">
          <span>OpenAI</span>
          <span>SendGrid</span>
          <span>Stripe</span>
          <span>Cloudflare</span>
          <span>AWS</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}

Then include it on the homepage where the old trust strip was:

import { TechStackStrip } from "@/components/TechStackStrip";

// ...

<TechStackStrip />

	5.	If using SVG logos instead of text

	•	Add SVGs (single-color gray) for: OpenAI, SendGrid, Stripe, Cloudflare, AWS.
	•	Set height to 20–28px and keep consistent visual weight.
	•	Replace the <span> elements in the example with <img> or <LogoXXX /> components, keeping the same flex layout.

⸻

	6.	Acceptance criteria

	•	Old Amazon/MicroStrategy/Google/Shopify/Stripe “trusted by” strip is completely removed.
	•	New section shows the heading “POWERED BY INDUSTRY-LEADING AI & INFRASTRUCTURE”.
	•	Below the heading, OpenAI / SendGrid / Stripe / Cloudflare / AWS appear in a clean horizontal row on desktop, wrap nicely on mobile, and match the site’s existing typography/colors.
