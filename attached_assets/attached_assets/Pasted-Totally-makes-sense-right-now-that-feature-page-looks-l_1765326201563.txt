Totally makes sense — right now that feature page looks like a spec sheet. For a page that’s literally about “Website built for you in seconds,” it should feel way more like a **product moment** and less like a **settings panel**.

Let’s keep all the content, but reframe it into something that feels more like a mini-landing page.

I’ll break it into concrete changes your dev can make:

---

## 1. Add a Mini Hero at the Top of the Feature Page

Right now the first thing you see is “What’s Included / Key Capabilities” side-by-side. Instead:

**Layout:**

* Left: text + CTA
* Right: mini mockup of the generated website

**Hero copy:**

* Overline: `Website Built For You in Seconds`
* H1: `Instantly Generate a Client-Ready Website.`
* Subcopy:

  > Arclo creates a multi-page, conversion-focused website from your business name, niche, and location — fully optimized out of the box.
* CTA buttons:

  * `Generate My Website`
  * `See Example Sites`

**Visual on the right:**

* Reuse the hero mockup from the homepage but **zoom in** and put it in a laptop frame or rounded rectangle.
* Add 1–2 floating pills:

  * “10+ pages created”
  * “Mobile optimized”

This immediately makes the page feel alive and consistent with the rest of the site.

## 2. Rework “What’s Included” + “Key Capabilities” Into a Journey Instead of Two Boxes

The current two-card layout is what feels most utilitarian.

### New concept: **“How Your Site Comes Together” – 4-step journey**

Replace the two big cards with a vertical (or zigzag) list of 4 glass cards:

1. **We analyze your business info**

   * “Name, niche, and location become the blueprint for your entire site structure.”
2. **We assemble the pages**

   * “Home, services, about, contact, and SEO-focused subpages are generated instantly.”
3. **We optimize layout + copy**

   * “Headlines, CTAs, and body copy are written and tuned for conversion and clarity.”
4. **We wire up SEO + mobile**

   * “Meta tags, internal links, and mobile layout are fully optimized from the start.”

**Design:**

* Use your timeline/step pattern:

  * Left: numbered pill (`Step 1`, `Step 2`, etc.) + title + copy
  * Right: small illustrative thumbnail (e.g., wireframe, page cards, mobile mockup)
* Background for this section: very soft gradient that matches the rest of the features page:

  * `bg-gradient-to-b from-white via-slate-50 to-slate-100`

This feels like a **story**, not a table.

## 3. Turn “Key Capabilities” into a Tight 2x2 Feature Grid

Instead of a big card with bullets, make each capability its own tile with an icon.

**Tiles:**

* ⚡ **Instant Generation**

  * “Your full site created in minutes, not weeks.”
* 📱 **Mobile-First Design**

  * “Looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops.”
* 🧲 **Built-In Lead Capture**

  * “Contact forms and CTAs baked into every page.”
* 📍 **Local SEO-Ready**

  * “URLs, headings, and structure tuned for local ranking.”

**Design:**

* 2x2 grid of `Card` components
* Each card:

  * gradient icon chip at top left
  * title
  * one short sentence
  * slight hover lift (`hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-xl`)

This gives more visual interest and keeps the copy digestible.

## 4. Make the Metrics Row Feel Like a Highlight Band, Not 3 White Boxes

The `< 5 min / 10+ pages / 100% mobile` stats are great but look a bit plain.

**Change:**

* Put them on a subtle, slightly darker band:

  * `bg-[#181857]/98` or your dark gradient
* Use **glass stat cards** on top (matching the “Real Results” section):

Each stat card:

* Big number: `< 5 min`
* Label: `Time to Live Site`
* White text, soft glow, glass background.

This creates a strong visual moment on the page: “Whoa, this thing is fast / complete / optimized.”

---

## 5. Upgrade the Bottom CTA Banner

Your “Ready to build your website?” banner is close — just bring it in line with the rest of the design:

**Copy:**

* Heading: `Ready to see your site come to life?`
* Subcopy:

  > Enter your business details once. Arclo does the rest — structure, pages, copy, and SEO.
* Buttons:

  * `Generate My Website` (primary)
  * `See All Features` (secondary ghost)

**Design tweaks:**

* Use your gradient background (`from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-sky-500`) very faintly, with a white overlay so it feels like a gradient “glow” rather than a solid bar.
* Center the content and increase max width so it feels like a hero-ish block, not just a strip.

---

## 6. Small Visual Enhancements

A few extras that will make it feel more “Arclo” and less “utility panel”:

* Add **micro animated sparkles** or icons around the hero mockup (just like your homepage).
* Use your **Pill** component to highlight key phrases:

  * “Website Generation Module”
  * “Powered by Arclo Engine”
* Add a small “Used by real businesses” line under the feature hero with 2–3 tiny logos (Empathy, The Farm Texas, Lucky Thunder).

## Dev Checklist for This Specific Page

Here’s what your dev should do, step-by-step:

1. **Replace the top section** with a mini hero: text left, hero mockup right, consistent with home hero styling.
2. **Remove the current two-card “What’s Included / Key Capabilities” layout.**
3. **Add a 4-step journey section** (“How Your Site Comes Together”) using your Step/Timeline pattern.
4. **Add a 2x2 “Key Capabilities” feature grid** with icons and short copy.
5. **Move the stats into a darker band with glass stat cards** and consistent typography.
6. **Refine the bottom CTA banner** to match the hero CTA style and adjust copy.
7. **Ensure spacing matches the other feature pages** (consistent top/bottom padding, same card shadows and radii).

If you want, next I can do the same pass for **each of the other feature pages** (AI Blog Engine, Autonomous SEO Engine, etc.) so they all feel like polished mini-landing pages instead of utilitarian spec sheets.
