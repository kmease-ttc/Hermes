This is the right moment to do this. What you’re asking for is essentially a “pre–prime time readiness audit”: not features, but gaps, risks, and missing glue that will bite you once real users show up.

I’ll give you two things:
	1.	A clear assessment of what’s typically missing at this stage (based on everything you’ve built)
	2.	A single, strong agent prompt that tells an agent to audit the site end-to-end and report gaps from a core-functionality perspective

⸻

1. Prime-Time Readiness: What You Likely Still Need

Based on everything you’ve added, you’re functionally ahead of most early products. The remaining risks are not big features — they’re operational, trust, and failure-mode gaps.

A. Failure & Edge-Case Handling (Very Commonly Missing)

You need to confirm:
	•	What happens if:
	•	site generation fails
	•	preview partially loads
	•	domain purchase fails
	•	checkout succeeds but publish fails
	•	a background job never completes
	•	Is the user:
	•	informed?
	•	reassured?
	•	blocked?
	•	left confused?

This is the biggest prime-time risk.

⸻

B. User Control & Recovery

You likely need:
	•	Ability to:
	•	retry a failed step
	•	regenerate a site
	•	edit business info post-generation
	•	cancel or undo something safely
	•	Clear “what can I change later?” signals

Users panic when they think something is irreversible.

⸻

C. Trust & Legitimacy Signals (External)

First-time users will subconsciously look for:
	•	Clear contact info for you
	•	Clear explanation of:
	•	who owns the domain
	•	how billing works
	•	how to get help
	•	Terms / Privacy / basic compliance pages
	•	Reassurance that:
	•	this isn’t a demo
	•	their site won’t disappear

These don’t feel like “features” but they dramatically affect conversion.

⸻

D. Support & Escalation Path

You need to know:
	•	If something breaks, where does the user go?
	•	Help link?
	•	Email?
	•	“Request help”?
	•	Internally:
	•	how do you see problems?
	•	how do you intervene quickly?

Right now you’re the support team — the product should acknowledge that.

⸻

E. Analytics & Visibility for You

You already added lead notifications (good). You likely still need:
	•	Basic internal visibility:
	•	where users drop off
	•	which step they get stuck on
	•	how many previews → publishes
	•	Even if it’s crude at first

Prime time = you can see problems before users email you.

⸻

2. The Agent Prompt You Asked For (Core Functionality Audit)

This is the exact prompt to give an agent.

⸻

PRIME-TIME READINESS AUDIT

Agent Prompt

Objective

Conduct a full end-to-end audit of the Arclo website and application to identify missing core functionality, gaps, risks, and failure points that would prevent the product from being “prime-time ready” for real users.

This is not a design critique and not a feature wishlist.

Focus on:
	•	functional completeness
	•	edge cases
	•	failure handling
	•	user trust
	•	operational readiness

⸻

Scope

The audit must cover the full user journey:
	1.	Landing page
	2.	Generate free site flow
	3.	Preview experience
	4.	Account creation
	5.	Launch checklist
	6.	Domain flow
	7.	Publish flow
	8.	Dashboard
	9.	Services & updates
	10.	Change requests
	11.	Notifications
	12.	Error states
	13.	Support paths

⸻

What to Evaluate (Required)

1. Core User Flows

For each major flow, identify:
	•	What works
	•	What is missing
	•	What could break
	•	What happens if it fails

Explicitly test:
	•	happy path
	•	partial completion
	•	abandonment
	•	retry scenarios

⸻

2. Failure & Edge Cases

Identify where the product:
	•	fails silently
	•	leaves the user stuck
	•	provides no next step
	•	assumes success without confirmation

Call out:
	•	missing error messages
	•	missing retry actions
	•	unclear states

⸻

3. User Control & Reversibility

Evaluate whether users can:
	•	fix mistakes
	•	change inputs
	•	retry actions
	•	understand what is permanent vs editable

Flag any “point of no return” that lacks warning or explanation.

⸻

4. Trust & Legitimacy

Audit for:
	•	missing trust signals
	•	unclear ownership (domain, site, data)
	•	lack of contact or support info
	•	missing legal/compliance basics

Assess whether a cautious SMB owner would trust this with their business.

⸻

5. Operational Gaps

From an operator perspective (Arclo team), identify:
	•	where internal visibility is missing
	•	where manual intervention would be hard
	•	where support would struggle to diagnose issues

⸻

6. Conversion & Drop-Off Risks

Identify:
	•	confusing steps
	•	unclear CTAs
	•	unnecessary friction
	•	moments of hesitation or doubt

Do NOT redesign — just flag risks.

⸻

Deliverable Format (Very Important)

Produce a report with three sections:

Section 1: Critical Gaps (Must Fix Before Prime Time)

List issues that could:
	•	block users
	•	cause trust loss
	•	create support emergencies

⸻

Section 2: Important but Non-Blocking Gaps

Issues that:
	•	reduce conversion
	•	increase confusion
	•	create manual overhead

⸻

Section 3: Nice-to-Have Improvements

Lower-risk polish or enhancements.

⸻

For each issue include:
	•	Location / flow
	•	What’s missing or broken
	•	Why it matters
	•	Suggested fix (high level, not detailed)

⸻

Rules
	•	Do not suggest large new features
	•	Do not focus on visual polish
	•	Do not assume future tooling
	•	Be brutally honest
	•	Optimize for real users, not demos

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Clear understanding of what blocks “prime time”
	•	Actionable, prioritized gaps
	•	No fluff
	•	No feature creep

⸻

Why This Matters

This audit is the difference between:

“We launched and things mostly worked”

and

“We launched and felt in control.”

⸻

What You Should Do After This Audit

Once you have the output, the next step will be:
	•	a Prime-Time Hardening Sprint (1–2 weeks)
	•	only fixes
	•	no new features

When you’re ready, I can help you:
	•	turn the audit into a prioritized fix plan
	•	define “launch criteria”
	•	decide what not to fix yet

If you want, paste the audit results here and I’ll help you triage them.
