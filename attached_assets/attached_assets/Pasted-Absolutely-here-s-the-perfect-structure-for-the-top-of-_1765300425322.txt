Absolutely — here’s the **perfect structure** for the top of your *What We Do* page:

## 1. A clean, premium summary section at the top

## 2. A landing-page-ready module for each item (A–F)

I’ll give you both:
✔ the **summary copy**
✔ the **section breakdown**
✔ the **developer-ready structure for new landing pages**
✔ and optional hero copy for each one

---

# ✅ **PART 1 — Summary Section (to place ABOVE the accordions)**

Your current page jumps straight into “The Complete Engine.”
You want a summary at the top that explains the entire system in a fast, simple way.

Here is the copy & structure you should use:

---

## ⭐ **Summary Heading**

```
Everything Arclo Does For You Automatically
```

## ⭐ **Summary Subheading**

```
Arclo is a fully autonomous website and SEO engine.  
Here’s a quick overview of every component that works behind the scenes  
to grow your traffic and generate customers — without agencies, plugins,  
or manual work.
```

---

# ⭐ **Six-Block Summary Grid (A–F modules)**

This sits under the summary text and above your accordion.

Style:

* 3-column on desktop
* 1-column on mobile
* each block is a glass card with an icon + title + 1–2-line summary

Here is the content for each card:

---

### **A. Website Generation**

Builds your entire website instantly — pages, navigation, structure, branding, and CTAs — fully optimized from day one.

---

### **B. Keyword Intelligence & Content Strategy**

Maps every keyword opportunity for your business and city, grouped into content clusters and prioritized for realistic wins.

---

### **C. Daily Autonomous SEO Optimization**

Fixes your site every single day — metadata, internal links, technical issues, content tuning, and more — based on live search behavior.

---

### **D. Google Search Console Integration**

Uses real search data (queries, clicks, impressions) to automatically adapt your SEO strategy and highlight rising or falling pages.

---

### **E. Weekly “SEO Wave” Optimization**

Bigger scheduled enhancements run weekly: schema updates, internal linking boosts, text rewrites, and quality improvements.

---

### **F. Image Intelligence**

Optimizes all images for speed and SEO. Generates clean alt text, compresses files, and sources new images automatically when needed.

# ✅ PART 2 — Build a Landing Page for Each Module (A–F)

Each module becomes its own landing page.

These should follow **the same structure** as your homepage:

---

# ⭐ **MODULE PAGE TEMPLATE (use for all A–F pages)**

Use the route structure:

```
/website-generation
/keyword-intelligence
/autonomous-seo
/search-console
/seo-wave
/image-intelligence
```

Each page contains:

---

## ✨ 1. HERO SECTION (module-specific)

### Example hero for Website Generation:

```
HeroTitle: Build Your Entire Website in Seconds  
HeroSubtitle: Arclo generates your entire site — pages, structure, design, 
and SEO — instantly and automatically.  
CTA: Generate My Website  
```

### Example hero for Keyword Intelligence:

```
HeroTitle: Your Entire Keyword Universe, Automatically Mapped  
HeroSubtitle: Arclo identifies what your business can realistically rank for 
and creates topic clusters that fuel your growth.  
```

### Example hero for Autonomous SEO:

```
HeroTitle: Your Site Improves Every Single Day — Automatically  
HeroSubtitle: Arclo fixes metadata, internal links, content quality, and 
technical issues without agencies or plugins.  
```

---

## ✨ 2. What This Module Does (3–6 bullets)

Each module gets a card or list explaining its capabilities.

**Example for Keyword Intelligence:**

* Discovers every local search variation customers use
* Groups keywords by topic clusters
* Scores keywords by difficulty + opportunity
* Generates SEO content briefs
* Updates your strategy weekly based on search trends

---

## ✨ 3. Visual Explainer Panel (module-specific mockup)

Examples:

* Website Generation → mockup of a site being assembled
* Autonomous SEO → daily fixes dashboard
* Keyword Intelligence → bubble graph of clusters
* Image Intelligence → before/after image optimization

---

## ✨ 4. Results Panel (pulled from your stats section)

Reuse your “+300% calls / +120% traffic / 84 fixes” panel across pages.

---

## ✨ 5. CTA Footer

# 📐 Developer Instructions for All Module Pages

### 1. Generate 6 new routes:

```

client/src/pages/autonomous-seo.tsx  
client/src/pages/search-console.tsx  
client/src/pages/seo-wave.tsx

```

### 2. Each page imports:

### 3. Reuse shared components so every page looks consistent.

### 4. Each landing page should link back to the main “What We Do” page.

### 5. Add CTA buttons that match the hero styling.
