I wasn’t able to crawl your site pages automatically (the open request returned no page content), so I can’t produce an exact page-by-page audit by scanning the live HTML. However, I can give you a detailed, practical checklist of things to check and action items you can hand off to your developer — covering broken/inconsistent elements, missing SEO/UX items, technical issues, and best practices for a SaaS/marketing site like Arclo (which, from what I can see, is about autonomous website creation & SEO generation).  ￼

⸻

✅ 1. Broken Links & Resources

Ask your developer to:
	•	Run a full site link crawl (Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, Sitebulb).
	•	Flag 404s, 500s, redirect loops, or orphan pages.
	•	Check that all internal links point to live, relevant pages.
	•	Confirm that image/video assets load correctly (no broken URLs).
	•	Validate CSS/JS files load without errors.

Deliverable for dev:

A report listing broken/mislinked URLs, missing assets, and 404 pages grouped by severity.

⸻

✅ 2. SEO & Metadata Consistency

For each page:
	•	Title tags should be:
	•	Unique
	•	~50–60 characters
	•	Keyword relevant
	•	Meta descriptions should be:
	•	Unique
	•	~120–155 characters
	•	Compelling (improve CTR)
	•	Ensure H1 tags match primary topic/keyword intent.
	•	Check canonical tags are set properly if there are similar pages.

SEO items to verify:
	•	XML sitemap exists + submitted to search engines.
	•	Robots.txt present and not blocking important pages.
	•	Proper use of structured data/schema (e.g., Organization, Breadcrumb).
	•	Alt attributes on all images.

Deliverable for dev:

An SEO audit export showing missing/duplicate titles & descriptions, and schema coverage.

⸻

✅ 3. Mobile & Responsive Issues

Test and fix:
	•	Navigation usability on phones/tablets.
	•	Text visibility (no overlapping text/buttons).
	•	Touch targets at least ~48px.
	•	Images scale properly (no overflow).

Deliverable for dev:

Device screenshots with annotations of layout breakpoints and fixes needed.

⸻

✅ 4. Page Speed & Performance

Important for SEO & conversions:
	•	Compress images (WebP where appropriate).
	•	Use lazy loading for below-the-fold assets.
	•	Minify CSS, JS.
	•	Enable caching/HTTP/2 or CDN if not already.
	•	Eliminate render-blocking scripts.

Run tests:
	•	Google PageSpeed Insights / Lighthouse on key pages.
	•	Report mobile & desktop scores.

Deliverable for dev:

PageSpeed report + prioritized list of improvements.

⸻

✅ 5. Analytics & Tracking

Confirm:
	•	Google Analytics (GA4) or equivalent implemented on all pages.
	•	Conversion tracking (forms, button CTRs) is firing correctly.
	•	UTM campaigns are tracked consistently.

Deliverable for dev:

A list of events/goals and where they are implemented (incl. screenshots of tag manager setup).

⸻

✅ 6. Security & Technical
	•	Verify HTTPS/SSL certificate is valid on all hostnames.
	•	Check for mixed content (http assets on https pages).
	•	Run an automated SSL/HTTPS checker.
	•	Ensure security headers are set (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options).
	•	Test performance under load if applicable (especially for landing pages).

Deliverable for dev:

A report of security header gaps + fix plan.

⸻

✅ 7. User Experience (UX) / Conversion Optimization

Review the following areas and refine:

Navigation
	•	Clear primary menu with consistent wording and ordering.
	•	Breadcrumbs if deep content.

Hero & CTAs
	•	Strong headline + subheadline that explains value quickly.
	•	Primary CTA visible without scrolling.
	•	Secondary actions available but not competing.

Forms
	•	Short & simple.
	•	Validate client & server side.
	•	Thank you / confirmation pages.

Social Proof
	•	Testimonials or client logos where relevant.
	•	Case studies if you have them.

Footer
	•	Contact info, privacy policy, terms, sitemap link.

Deliverable for dev/designer:

A UX improvements list tied to screenshots/wireframes.

⸻

✅ 8. Content & Messaging

Without crawling the pages, ask:
	•	Is every page aligned with your brand voice and clarity of offer?
	•	Do pages answer:
	1.	What is this?
	2.	Who is it for?
	3.	What problem does it solve?
	4.	What’s the next step (CTA)?
	•	Do product/service pages have:
	•	Benefits vs features
	•	Pricing/plan transparency if applicable

Deliverable for content owner:

A content matrix showing missing value props, benefits, or FAQs.

If you want, give me a list of the main pages (URLs) you care about and I can turn this into a specific page-by-page checklist with concrete recommendations per page.
