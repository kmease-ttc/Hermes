Below are clear, copy-pasteable instructions for the Replit Agent.
This is written as a product + UX + workflow implementation brief, not commentary.

Arclo — Launch Readiness, Setup Services, and Upsell Framework

Agent Instructions

Objective

Transform the current “Let’s get your site ready to launch” experience into:
	1.	A clean, consistent, high-confidence launch checklist
	2.	A set of optional done-for-you setup services
	3.	A service-driven upsell system tied to “What’s Next”
	4.	A visually consistent UI aligned with the rest of Arclo

This work should not change core generation logic. It is UI, workflow, and service orchestration.

⸻

PART 1 — Fix the Launch Readiness Workflow

Current Problem
	•	Steps feel arbitrary
	•	Advanced tasks (Search Console, Analytics) are shown without context
	•	No explanation of why a step matters
	•	No “we’ll do this for you” option
	•	Visual design is inconsistent with the rest of the app

⸻

Required Changes

1. Rename the Section
Change:
“Let’s get your site ready to launch”

To:
“Launch checklist”
Subtext:
“Complete these steps to get your site live and visible on Google.”

⸻

2. Reorder the Steps (Critical)
Reorder steps into logical dependency order:
	1.	Confirm your business info
	2.	Choose your primary services
	3.	Choose your service areas
	4.	Connect domain
	5.	Publish your website
	6.	Connect Google Search Console
	7.	Connect Analytics

Rules
	•	Steps 1–5 = required to launch
	•	Steps 6–7 = optional but recommended
	•	Visually separate “Required” vs “Recommended”

⸻

3. Each Step Must Have Inline Explanation
Each checklist item must include:
	•	Short explanation (1 sentence)
	•	“Why this matters” tooltip or subtext
	•	Clear CTA

Example:

Connect Google Search Console
“Helps Google index your site and track search visibility.”
[Why this matters]
[Connect]
[Have Arclo do this for me]

⸻

PART 2 — Add Done-For-You Setup Services (Key Revenue Opportunity)

Principle

Many customers:
	•	Don’t have websites
	•	Don’t know what Search Console or Analytics are
	•	Will happily pay to avoid setup friction

You must offer assisted setup at every advanced step.

⸻

Setup Services to Implement

Service 1: Launch Setup Assistance
One-time service

Includes:
	•	Google Search Console setup
	•	Google Analytics setup
	•	Tag installation + verification
	•	Sitemap submission

Price:
$149 one-time

Placement:
	•	Inline on checklist steps 6 & 7
	•	As a bundle offer: “Let Arclo handle launch setup”

Copy:
“We’ll connect everything for you and confirm it’s working.”

⸻

Service 2: Google Visibility Setup
Optional add-on (recurring or one-time)

Includes:
	•	Search Console monitoring
	•	Indexing validation
	•	Sitemap + structured data checks

Price:
	•	$19/month or
	•	$99/year

This service should unlock ongoing ‘visibility’ tasks in “What’s Next”.

⸻

PART 3 — Redesign “What’s Next” as a Service Marketplace

Current Problem
	•	“What’s Next” feels passive
	•	No upsell path
	•	Activities feel random
	•	No connection to purchased plan

⸻

Required Changes

1. Split “What’s Next” Into Two Sections
Section A: Active Services
Title:
“Active Services”
Subtext:
“These are currently running for your site.”

Only show tasks tied to:
	•	Base plan
	•	Purchased add-ons

Each item shows:
	•	Service name
	•	What it does
	•	Frequency
	•	Status (Scheduled / Running / Completed)

⸻

Section B: Available Services
Title:
“Available Services”
Subtext:
“Add more growth and visibility to your site.”

This is the upsell engine.

Each service card must include:
	•	Plain-language description
	•	Outcome
	•	Price
	•	CTA: Subscribe or Add

⸻

Service Catalog (Required)

The agent must create a service registry with at least these services:

Core Services
	•	Technical SEO maintenance
	•	Keyword expansion
	•	Performance optimization
	•	Structured data enhancements

Content Services
	•	Blog writing (monthly)
	•	Service page expansion
	•	Location page expansion
	•	Homepage refresh

Visibility Services
	•	Google Search Console monitoring
	•	Analytics insights
	•	Ranking tracking

Conversion Services (future-ready)

	•	Contact form tuning
	•	Copy improvements

Each service must define:

	•	Frequency
	•	Required inputs
	•	UI visibility

⸻

PART 4 — Visual & UX Fixes (Mandatory)

Problems to Fix
	•	Buttons are inconsistent (not using primary purple)
	•	Bottom cards have poor contrast
	•	Dashboard feels visually disconnected from the marketing site

⸻

UI Instructions

Buttons
	•	All primary CTAs must use the same purple gradient
	•	No gray or outline buttons for primary actions
	•	Secondary actions use neutral outline style

⸻

Cards (What’s Next / Recently Completed)
	•	Increase contrast
	•	Use consistent card elevation
	•	Add subtle iconography (consistent style)
	•	Improve spacing and alignment

⸻

Progress Bar
	•	Make it visually prominent
	•	Label clearly:
“Launch progress: 2 of 7 complete”
	•	Use the same purple as the rest of the brand

⸻

PART 5 — Behavior Rules
	•	Do not overwhelm users with advanced steps early
	•	Always explain why something matters
	•	Always offer “Arclo can do this for you”
	•	Never block launch on optional steps
	•	Upsells must feel helpful, not salesy

⸻

PART 6 — Non-Goals (Do Not Implement Yet)
	•	Agency dashboards
	•	Bulk site management
	•	White-label workflows
	•	Manual DNS instructions
	•	Support ticketing system

⸻

Final Deliverables for This Task

The agent must produce:
	1.	Updated launch checklist flow
	2.	Assisted setup services with pricing
	3.	Service catalog powering “What’s Next”
	4.	Updated UI styles for this page
	5.	Clear upsell entry points tied to real value

⸻

If you want next:
	•	I can price every service precisely
	•	Write exact UI copy for each step
	•	Define background jobs for each service
	•	Create Playwright tests for this entire workflow

Just tell me which one to do next.
