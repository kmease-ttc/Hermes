At this point, the next most important thing is:

👉 Reliability + Confidence: Automated QA, Monitoring, and “Release Safety”

You’re about to:
	•	sell setup services
	•	publish customer sites
	•	run background jobs
	•	make ongoing changes automatically

If something silently breaks, trust collapses.

So the next workstream should make Arclo feel safe, professional, and production-ready by adding:
	•	automated QA
	•	site health checks
	•	visible monitoring
	•	failure surfacing (not hiding)

This directly reduces churn, support, and anxiety.

⸻

NEXT WORKSTREAM: QA, Monitoring, and Site Health

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement an automated QA + monitoring layer that continuously validates:
	•	Arclo itself
	•	customer sites
	•	critical workflows (publish, domain, tracking, pages)

The system must:
	•	catch issues early
	•	surface problems clearly
	•	tie failures to activities
	•	reinforce trust that Arclo is “on it”

⸻

PART 1 — Add Automated QA Runner (Playwright)

1) Integrate Playwright

Add Playwright to the repo and configure it for headless execution.

Create a /qa or /tests directory with:
	•	smoke.spec.ts
	•	publish-flow.spec.ts
	•	site-health.spec.ts

⸻

2) Smoke Tests (Platform)

Implement smoke tests that run against Arclo itself:

Validate:
	•	login
	•	dashboard load
	•	“My Websites” page renders
	•	preview page renders
	•	publish button exists
	•	service subscription flow loads

Fail tests on:
	•	uncaught JS errors
	•	failed navigation
	•	missing critical elements

⸻

3) Publish Flow Test (Critical)

Create a test that simulates:
	1.	Generate site
	2.	Preview site
	3.	Click “Publish”
	4.	Stop before payment (mock)
	5.	Confirm checklist loads
	6.	Confirm domain step renders

This test ensures your core funnel never breaks.

⸻

PART 2 — Customer Site Health Checks (Huge Trust Win)

1) Add Site Health Job

Create a scheduled job (daily or weekly per site) that checks:
	•	Site returns 200
	•	Homepage loads within X seconds
	•	No JS fatal errors
	•	Sitemap reachable
	•	Robots.txt reachable
	•	Core pages exist

Store results as site_health_checks.

⸻

2) Surface Health in Dashboard

Add a “Site Health” indicator per site card:
	•	Healthy (green)
	•	Needs attention (yellow)
	•	Issue detected (red)

Clicking opens:
	•	What failed
	•	When
	•	What Arclo is doing about it

⸻

PART 3 — Tie QA & Health to Activities

Rules
	•	Every failed check creates an activity with status=failed
	•	Every recovery creates an activity with status=completed
	•	No silent failures

Example:
“Detected broken sitemap — repairing automatically”
or
“Homepage failed to load — investigating”

⸻

PART 4 — Failure Visibility & Trust

In-App Alerts

If a site health issue occurs:
	•	Show alert in dashboard
	•	Do NOT panic the user
	•	Use calm language:
“We detected an issue and are working on it.”

Email Alerts (Only for serious issues)

Send email only if:
	•	site is down
	•	domain expired
	•	tracking removed

⸻

PART 5 — Admin Controls (Early-Stage Friendly)

Create internal admin views to:
	•	see failing QA runs
	•	see site health across all customers
	•	rerun checks
	•	mark issues resolved
	•	attach notes

This allows manual intervention without exposing internals.

⸻

PART 6 — QA for Services (Forward-Looking)

Add hooks so that:
	•	when a service runs (blog publish, page creation, SEO fix)
	•	a lightweight validation runs after
	•	success/failure is logged as activity

This prevents:
	•	“we think it ran” uncertainty
	•	invisible failures

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Playwright tests run locally
	•	Core flows are protected
	•	Customer sites are monitored
	•	Issues are visible, not hidden
	•	Users trust Arclo to catch problems before they do

⸻

Why this is the right next step

You now have:
	•	onboarding
	•	services
	•	upsells
	•	activity tracking

The missing piece is confidence at scale.

This work makes Arclo feel like:

“An always-on website operations platform”

not:

“An AI experiment that might break.”

⸻

After this, the next two logical options are:
	1.	Onboarding + empty states + education (conversion & activation), or
	2.	Pricing page + packaging rewrite (revenue optimization)

Tell me which one you want next and I’ll write that prompt.
