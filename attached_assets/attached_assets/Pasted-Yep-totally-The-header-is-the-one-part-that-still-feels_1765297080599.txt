Yep, totally. The header is the one part that still feels very “default SaaS template.” Let’s keep it clean but give it some personality and depth.

Here are concrete upgrades you can hand your dev.

---

## 1. Turn the header into a subtle “glass bar” instead of flat white

Right now it’s just a white strip. Make it feel more product-y:

* Background:

  * `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-xl`
* Border:

  * `border border-slate-200/60`
* Shadow:

  * `shadow-sm`
* Rounded corners on desktop:

  * Wrap nav in a container:
    `rounded-full px-4 py-2`

Structure:

* Outer wrapper (full width) still on the light page bg.
* Inner nav as a **floating pill** centered in a max-width container.

Visually this gives: floating glass nav bar with logo + links + CTA.

---

## 2. Add a tiny “status strip” above or inside the header

Something like:

* A thin bar above the nav:

  `Now quietly improving 37,421 pages for local businesses.`

or

`Built for people who don’t want to think about SEO.` (reuse your tagline)

Styling:

* `text-[11px] uppercase tracking-[0.16em] text-indigo-600`
* Sits centered above the nav, very subtle.

This makes the top feel intentional, not just “logo + links.”

---

## 3. Make the logo / brand lockup feel more like a product

Right now it’s just the mark + name. Give it a little system-feel:

* Keep logo + “Arclo”
* Add a tiny tag under or next to it:

  `Arclo`
  `AI Website Engine`

So in code you’d have:

* `flex flex-col leading-tight` on desktop:

  * top: `Arclo` (text-slate-900 font-semibold)
  * bottom: `AI Website Engine` (text-[11px] uppercase text-slate-400)

Small change, big perceived polish.

## 4. Upgrade the nav links into subtle pills

Instead of plain text links:

* Use `rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm`
* On hover:

  * `bg-slate-100 text-slate-900`
* Active page:

  * `bg-slate-900 text-white`

This keeps it minimal but gives more “designed” energy.

Example: `What We Do | Examples | Pricing | About`

## 5. Make the primary CTA feel like a “button from the product”

Right now it’s a standard SaaS CTA. Tie it to your brand:

* Text: `Generate My Website`
* Small right icon:

  * `→` or a sparkle/bolt icon
* Style:

  * `rounded-full bg-indigo-600 text-white px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium`
  * Hover: `bg-indigo-700 shadow-[0_12px_30px_rgba(79,70,229,0.4)]`

Optional: add a **soft inner glow** or gradient:

* `bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-500 via-violet-500 to-sky-500`

---

## 6. Add a scroll interaction (simple but impactful)

On scroll:

* Header sticks to top (`sticky top-4 z-50`)
* Slightly shrink padding (`py-1` → `py-0.5`)
* Increase backdrop blur and shadow.

That makes the header feel “alive” without any wild animation.

---

## 7. Optional: “Command bar” experiment

If you want something more unique:

* Replace one nav link (e.g., “What We Do”) with a **ghost command bar**:

  `[ 🔍 Ask what Arclo can do for my business… ]`

* On click, scrolls to “How it Works” or opens a modal.

Even without full functionality, visually this screams: *AI, not another brochure site.*

---

If you’d like, I can write a header JSX/Tailwind snippet that implements:

* floating glass nav pill
* logo + sublabel
* pill-style links
* gradient CTA
* sticky-on-scroll behavior

ready for your dev to paste into `Layout` or `Home.tsx`.
