Yes — you 100% should add tooltips.
This will immediately improve conversions, reduce user confusion, and decrease support questions.

But they must be written in plain language, NOT technical language.
(Remember: your customers are plumbers, bakers, cleaners, local med spas — not designers.)

Below are the developer instructions on where to add tooltips, how they must behave, and EXACT copy you should use.

⸻

✅ DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS — ADD TOOLTIP SYSTEM TO ARCLO ONBOARDING

We are adding tooltips to the entire onboarding/business-info form.

Tooltips must:
	•	Be available on hover (desktop)
	•	Be available on tap (mobile)
	•	Use a small “?” icon next to the label
	•	Display in plain-language
	•	Not use SEO/tech jargon
	•	Explain why it matters (the benefit) more than the definition

⸻

🎯 TOOLTIP BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS

1. Every tooltip is triggered by a small circle icon with “?”
	•	Should appear to the right of the form label
	•	Same styling across all fields
	•	On click/tap, tooltip appears above/below the field in a floating box

2. Tooltip box requirements:
	•	Soft rounded corners
	•	Slight shadow
	•	Light neutral background
	•	1–2 short paragraphs max
	•	One sentence bolded for the key takeaway

3. Tooltip placement:
	•	Must never obstruct the input field
	•	Must auto-adjust on mobile so it doesn’t go off-screen

⸻

📌 ADD TOOLTIP TO THESE FIELDS (MANDATORY)

Below is EXACT copy you can give to your dev to implement.

⸻

1. Business Name — Tooltip

Why we ask for this

This is the name we’ll put on your website and logo.
It helps us personalize your site, write your content, and generate your branding automatically.

⸻

2. Industry / Business Type — Tooltip

What this does

We use your industry to generate the right style, images, and wording for your website.
A bakery looks different from a plumber — this helps us customize everything.

⸻

3. City / Service Area — Tooltip

Why it matters

Your location tells Google where you serve customers.
This helps your website show up for people searching nearby.

⸻

4. Hero Image — Tooltip

(You specifically requested this — must be simple!)

A hero image is the big banner photo at the top of your website.
It’s the first thing customers see, so it sets the mood and shows what your business is about.

If you don’t upload one, we’ll create one for you automatically.

⸻

5. Business Photos Upload — Tooltip

Clarity for users

These photos help us design your site to look more like your business.
Upload anything that shows your work — products, storefront, before/after photos, or your team.

If you skip this, we’ll generate high-quality placeholder images.

⸻

6. Services You Offer — Tooltip

Why we ask

We use your services to build the pages customers look for on Google.
More accurate services = more people finding you online.

⸻

7. Business Description — Tooltip

Purpose

This helps us write your website content in your voice.
A short sentence or two is enough — we’ll expand it for you.

⸻

8. Phone Number — Tooltip

Why it matters

We add a “Call Now” button to your site so customers can reach you instantly.
Call tracking also helps you see how many customers your website brings in.

⸻

9. Address — Tooltip

When to use it

If you serve customers at a physical location, we’ll add a map to your site.
If you travel to customers, we’ll show your service area instead.

⸻

10. Hours of Operation — Tooltip

Why it’s useful

Customers and Google rely on accurate hours.
This helps people know when you’re open and increases trust.

⸻

11. Logo Upload (Optional) — Tooltip

Help the AI match your brand

If you already have a logo, upload it here.
If not, we’ll generate a clean, modern logo based on your business name and industry.

⸻

💡 OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TOOLTIP AREAS

These optional tooltips increase trust and reduce friction:

FAQ-style popups in the form
	•	“Why does Arclo ask these questions?”
	•	“What happens after I submit?”
	•	“Do I need technical skills?”

Tooltip explaining the AI

Arclo uses AI to build your website and improve it every day.
You don’t need to understand AI — you’ll just see more customers finding you.

⸻

🚀 DEVELOPER ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

A tooltip implementation is complete when:
	1.	Every tooltip looks consistent in style and behavior.
	2.	Tooltips load instantly — no noticeable delay.
	3.	No tooltip contains technical jargon.
	4.	Tooltip text fits on mobile without overflowing.
	5.	Click/tap outside the tooltip closes it.
	6.	Tooltips are available throughout onboarding, in the preview panel, and even inside the dashboard (later).

⸻

🌟 Want me to write plain-language copies for your entire onboarding form?

I can generate:
	•	The entire form UX rewritten for small business owners
	•	The new hero copy + benefit statements
	•	A full “walkthrough script” that explains how Arclo works in non-technical terms

Just tell me and I’ll produce it.
