Simplified Hero (Above the Fold)

Headline (1 line, punchy)

Your Website. Fully Automated. Always Improving.

Subheadline (1 short sentence)

Arclo builds, optimizes, and maintains your website so customers can find and contact you — without you thinking about SEO.

Primary CTA

Secondary (optional, small text under CTA)

No credit card • Live in under 60 seconds

What to REMOVE from the Hero

Move all of this below the fold into a “How It Works” or “What You Get” section:
	•	Bullet points explaining:
	•	60-second setup
	•	SEO issues fixed automatically
	•	Weekly content updates
	•	Monitoring and alerts
	•	The explanatory paragraph starting with
“Arclo builds your website, writes your content…”

These are good details — they just don’t belong in the hero.

⸻

Why This Works Better
	•	One idea: automation
	•	One outcome: customers find and contact you
	•	One action: generate site

The image already shows:
	•	SEO issues fixed
	•	Pages optimized
	•	Content published
	•	Calls tracked

So the copy doesn’t need to repeat it.

⸻

Optional Variations (If You Want to A/B Test)

Slightly more benefit-led

A Website That Runs Itself

Subheadline:
Arclo automatically builds and improves your site so you get more calls and leads — without hiring an SEO agency.

⸻

Even shorter (very strong)

A Website That Works for You

Subheadline:
Built, optimized, and updated automatically.

Dev / Designer Instructions (Clean Handoff)
	•	Limit hero copy to:
	•	1 headline
	•	1 subheadline
	•	1 primary CTA
	•	Max hero text height: ~4 lines total
	•	Move feature bullets to first section below the fold
	•	Keep current image + UI callouts (they’re doing the selling)
	•	Ensure headline is the only H1 on the page

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Rewrite the section immediately below the hero so it flows cleanly
	•	Tighten the value props into 3 scannable cards
	•	Align hero messaging more tightly to small business search intent

But this alone will make the page feel instantly calmer and more confident.
