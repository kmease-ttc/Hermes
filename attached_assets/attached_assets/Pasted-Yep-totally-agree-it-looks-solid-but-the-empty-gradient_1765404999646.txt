Yep, totally agree — it looks solid but the empty gradient makes it feel like a nice *wireframe*, not a real site. Let’s make “hero always has an image” a hard requirement.

Here’s exactly what to tell your developer.

---

### 1. Rule: Hero MUST use an image

For every generated site:

1. If user uploaded a hero image → use that.
2. Else if user uploaded any images → pick the best candidate and use as hero.
3. Else → generate a hero image with AI based on business type + city and use that.

No case should fall back to a flat gradient.

---

### 2. Hero implementation (background image + overlay)

In the generated site template, update the hero section:

* Use a `div` with CSS background image and overlay instead of just a gradient.

Something like:

```tsx
<section
  id="hero"
  className="relative flex min-h-[70vh] items-center justify-center px-6 py-20 text-white"
  style={{
    backgroundImage: `
      linear-gradient(to bottom right, rgba(15,23,42,0.80), rgba(15,23,42,0.65)),
      url('${heroImageUrl}')
    `,
    backgroundSize: "cover",
    backgroundPosition: "center",
  }}
>
  {/* existing hero content (badge, H1, sub, CTAs, trust icons) */}
</section>
```

Where `heroImageUrl` is resolved by the logic below.

---

### 3. Choosing `heroImageUrl`

In the site generation worker / function:

1. Collect IDs/URLs for:

   * `uploadedHeroImageUrl` (new field from form)
   * `uploadedImages[]` (existing multi-upload list)
   * `generatedHeroImageUrl` (AI-generated)

2. Add a helper:

```ts
function pickHeroImage(input: {
  uploadedHeroImageUrl?: string;
  uploadedImages?: string[];
  generatedHeroImageUrl?: string;
}): string {
  if (input.uploadedHeroImageUrl) return input.uploadedHeroImageUrl;
  if (input.uploadedImages && input.uploadedImages.length > 0) {
    // pick the first or the widest once you have metadata
    return input.uploadedImages[0];
  }
  if (input.generatedHeroImageUrl) return input.generatedHeroImageUrl;
  // last-resort fallback: generic stock per industry (never just a flat gradient)
  return getDefaultIndustryImage(input.businessType);
}
```

Store the chosen URL on the site model, e.g. `site.heroImageUrl`, and pass it into the template.

---

### 4. Generating the hero image (when none uploaded)

You already have OpenAI image generation wired for logos; reuse that for hero images.

Prompt per business:

```text
Ultra-realistic, modern website hero photo of a [business_type] working in [city].
Clean, bright, professional, wide landscape, no text or logos, for use as a website background.
```

* Save result to object storage under `/sites/{siteId}/hero.jpg`.
* Store URL as `generatedHeroImageUrl`.

If the AI call fails, fall back to a static, industry-specific stock image (one per business type).

---

### 5. Ensure preview uses the hero image

On the **Preview Ready** page, the mini browser card should load the same HTML/CSS as the real site, so once the template uses `heroImageUrl`, the preview will show it automatically.

Just confirm:

* The preview is pulling from the built site (`/public-objects/sites/{id}/index.html`)
* That build step already has `heroImageUrl` in its data.

---

### 6. Acceptance test

For every preview:

* Hero must show an actual photo (not just a blue/purple gradient)
* Text is readable because of the dark overlay
* The design still looks like your CK Heating and Air example.

If they send you a build without a hero image, they missed this spec.

---

You can drop this straight into a ticket: “Hero image must always be present; implement heroImageUrl selection + background image hero section.” Once they’ve done a pass, show me the new preview and we can tweak overlay, cropping, etc.
