DEV INSTRUCTIONS — GROWTH AUTOMATION FOR SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES (PHASE 1 + PHASE 2)

Goal
Drive qualified traffic + leads from small local businesses WITHOUT Google Ads and WITHOUT adding new site pages right now.

Success metrics (track weekly)
	•	Sessions from UTMs (source/medium/campaign)
	•	Signup conversions + conversion rate
	•	Replies booked / demos requested
	•	Email deliverability (bounce rate < 2%, spam complaints ~0)

Core principle
Automate “distribution + outreach,” not spam. Keep volume low, quality high, and always include manual approval where platforms are strict.

PHASE 1 — AUTOPILOT EXPOSURE (LOW RISK, START HERE)
We will publish 1 helpful “local business” post per week and syndicate it automatically.
	1.	Create a “Content Syndication” service
Repo structure

	•	/content/
	•	2025-12-13-why-local-sites-dont-rank.md
	•	2025-12-20-quick-local-seo-fixes.md
	•	/scripts/
	•	publish.ts (or publish.py)
	•	/config/
	•	channels.json
	•	authors.json
	•	/.env (secrets)

Post format (frontmatter required)
Each markdown file must include:
	•	title
	•	slug
	•	canonical_url (https://arclo.pro/blog/ OR https://arclo.pro/ if no blog)
	•	excerpt
	•	tags (local seo, small business, website)
	•	cta_url (https://arclo.pro/?utm_source=…)
	•	cta_text

Example UTM standard
	•	utm_source = {medium|substack|linkedin|gmb|reddit|ih}
	•	utm_medium = {syndication|social|community|outreach}
	•	utm_campaign = {launch_week1|launch_week2|…}
	•	utm_content = {post_slug}

	2.	Pick channels that are automatable safely
Do NOT automate Facebook Groups posting (high ban risk).
Do automate:
A) Medium (optional if we have account + API access)
B) Substack (newsletter + Notes) (if API is limited, fall back to “email newsletter send” + manual Notes)
C) LinkedIn company page (best for local businesses; can be semi-automated via scheduling tool or manual with generated copy)
D) Google Business Profile “Posts” (if you have a GBP for Arclo; great for local credibility)

Implementation approach (pragmatic)
	•	Build automation for:
	•	Generating “ready-to-post” channel-specific copy from markdown
	•	Scheduling + logging
	•	If a platform lacks clean API access, output a “posting packet” and place it in /outbox/ as JSON + a human-post checklist.

	3.	Build a “Posting Packet Generator” (automated output)
Input: /content/.md
Output per channel:

	•	headline
	•	short post (<= 300 chars)
	•	long post (600–1200 chars)
	•	3 hashtags (local-business-friendly)
	•	CTA line with UTM link
	•	1 image suggestion prompt (optional)

Write packets to:
	•	/outbox///.json

	4.	Add scheduling (Cron)

	•	Weekly publish job every Tuesday 9:00am Central
	•	Command: npm run publish – –date=today (or python script)
	•	The job:
	•	picks next unpublished markdown
	•	generates posting packets
	•	attempts API publish where supported
	•	logs results + failures

	5.	Logging + analytics for Phase 1
Create a small table (SQLite or Postgres; keep it simple)
Table: syndication_posts

	•	id
	•	slug
	•	channel
	•	status (queued|published|failed)
	•	published_url
	•	utm_url
	•	created_at
	•	published_at
	•	error_text

Add dashboard endpoint (admin-only)
	•	/admin/growth/syndication
	•	show each post, channel status, published URLs, clicks (if available), and signups attributed (from your analytics tool)

Definition of done (Phase 1)
	•	Dev can drop a markdown file into /content and it reliably produces posting packets
	•	At least one channel publishes automatically OR produces a clean manual packet
	•	UTMs are consistent and show up in analytics

PHASE 2 — AUTOMATED OUTREACH ENGINE (THIS WILL DRIVE LEADS)
We will identify local businesses with weak web presence, score them, generate a personalized outreach message, and send low-volume email with compliance + deliverability safeguards.

Target audience
Local service businesses (plumbers, HVAC, cleaning, landscaping, dental, med spa, electricians, roofing, etc.)

High-level system
A) Lead discovery → B) Website checks → C) Scoring → D) Personalized message → E) Send + track → F) Reply handling

IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS
	•	Start at 20 emails/day for 7 days; only increase if deliverability is good.
	•	Always include:
	•	Unsubscribe link
	•	Physical address
	•	“Why you’re receiving this” line
	•	Do NOT scrape or message personal emails; focus on business contact emails.

2.1 Lead discovery (sources)
Implement connectors in this order:

Connector A: Google Places API (preferred)
	•	Query by city + category (e.g., “plumber in Austin TX”)
	•	Collect:
	•	business name
	•	website
	•	phone
	•	address
	•	rating/review count
	•	place_id
Store in leads table.

Connector B: “Newly registered domains” (optional later)
Skip for now; Places is enough.

2.2 Website checks (automated audit)
For each lead with a website:
Fetch homepage HTML and compute quick signals:

Signals (MVP)
	•	has_https (true/false)
	•	ttfb_ms (rough)
	•	has_h1 (true/false)
	•	title_length
	•	meta_description_present
	•	has_viewport_meta (mobile)
	•	broken_links_count (optional)
	•	lighthouse_mobile_score (optional; expensive, run only on top prospects)
	•	has_schema (basic check for JSON-LD)
	•	is_wordpress/wix/squarespace (fingerprint optional)

Implementation notes
	•	Use a simple headless fetcher (Playwright OR axios + cheerio).
	•	Timeouts: 10–15 seconds max per site.
	•	Retry once on failure.
	•	Cache results 7 days.

2.3 Lead scoring
Score 0–100 based on “pain + ability to pay”
Example weights (tune later):
	•	No HTTPS: +25
	•	Missing meta description: +10
	•	No H1: +10
	•	Slow TTFB: +10
	•	Low review count but high category intent (e.g., roofer): +10
	•	Has website but clearly outdated: +10 (heuristic: old generator tags, tiny title, etc.)
	•	Has no website at all: +30 (if only a Facebook page or null website)

Store:
	•	score
	•	score_reasons (array of strings)

2.4 Personalization generator
For each lead above threshold (start with score >= 60):
Generate:
	•	1–2 sentence “what we noticed” using score_reasons
	•	A short “what Arclo does” line
	•	A single CTA

Template (must be short)
Subject options (rotate 3)
	•	Quick website fixes for {BusinessName}
	•	Noticed a couple site issues at {BusinessName}
	•	{BusinessName} — quick SEO/website upgrade

Body (structure)
Line 1: personalization (“I noticed …”)
Line 2: outcome (“We automatically …”)
Line 3: CTA with link (UTM + lead id)
Line 4: compliance footer + unsubscribe

Add a “preview link” (optional but powerful)
	•	Generate a “light audit report” page for that lead:
/audit/{lead_id}
Include:
	•	3 issues detected
	•	3 fixes Arclo would do
	•	CTA button

This does NOT require new “marketing pages,” it’s a functional lead artifact.

2.5 Sending infrastructure
Use SendGrid (you already have it) or a dedicated outbound tool.

Requirements
	•	Dedicated sending domain or subdomain recommended (e.g., mail.arclo.pro) once volume grows
	•	SPF, DKIM, DMARC configured
	•	List-Unsubscribe header enabled

Rate limits
	•	Day 1–7: 20/day
	•	Day 8–14: 40/day only if bounce < 2% and spam complaints are ~0
	•	Always randomize send times within business hours

Tables
leads
	•	id
	•	source (google_places)
	•	business_name
	•	website
	•	city
	•	category
	•	phone
	•	address
	•	place_id
	•	created_at

audits
	•	id
	•	lead_id
	•	fetched_at
	•	signals_json
	•	score
	•	score_reasons_json
	•	status (ok|failed)
	•	error_text

outreach_messages
	•	id
	•	lead_id
	•	audit_id
	•	subject
	•	body
	•	status (draft|approved|sent|bounced|replied|unsubscribed)
	•	send_at
	•	sent_at
	•	provider_message_id
	•	utm_url

events (optional)
	•	id
	•	provider_message_id
	•	type (delivered|open|click|bounce|spam|unsubscribe|reply)
	•	timestamp
	•	payload_json

2.6 Human-in-the-loop approval (required at first)
Build a simple admin queue:
	•	/admin/growth/outreach
Shows 20 drafted emails/day with:
	•	lead summary
	•	detected issues
	•	generated email
Buttons:
	•	Approve + schedule
	•	Edit + approve
	•	Skip

Do NOT auto-send without approval until you’ve tuned the templates.

2.7 Reply handling
At minimum:
	•	Route replies to a shared inbox (support@ or sales@)
	•	Log “reply received” in DB (via inbound parse webhook if supported, or manual tagging)

2.8 Tracking
Every outreach email CTA link must include:
	•	lead_id
	•	campaign
So you can attribute signups to outreach.

Definition of done (Phase 2 MVP)
	•	Lead discovery pulls 200–500 leads for 1 metro + 1–2 categories
	•	Audits run and score leads
	•	20 outreach drafts/day appear in admin queue
	•	Approved emails send successfully with proper unsubscribe/compliance
	•	You can see clicks/signups tied to lead_id

⸻

EXECUTION PLAN (DO THIS IN THIS ORDER)
Sprint 1 (2–3 days)
	•	Implement Phase 1 posting packet generator + UTM standard + logging
	•	Set up weekly cron + admin view

Sprint 2 (3–5 days)
	•	Implement Places lead discovery + basic audit + scoring + admin approval queue
	•	Send 20/day for one metro + one category

Initial targeting recommendation (keep it narrow)
Metro: Austin TX
Category: cleaning services OR landscaping (pick one)
Reason: easy to message, lots of fragmented small businesses, high pain tolerance for “we handle it for you”

If you want, next message I can write the exact Replit agent implementation prompt to build Phase 1 + Phase 2 (including DB schema + routes + cron + SendGrid hooks) in your current stack.
