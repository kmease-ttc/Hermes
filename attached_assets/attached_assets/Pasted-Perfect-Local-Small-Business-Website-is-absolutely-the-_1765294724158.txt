Perfect — **Local Small Business Website** is absolutely the right choice for your audience.

This will instantly resonate with:

* Home service providers
* Real estate professionals
* Local contractors
* Medical / wellness offices
* Small business owners
* Entrepreneurs

Because they will **see themselves** in the mockup and think:

### “WOW. If Arclo can build a site THIS good automatically, I’m in.”

So here is the exact hero mockup I will create for you — and you can send these instructions directly to your designer or have me generate the asset next.

# ✅ **Arclo Hero Mockup — Local Small Business Website (Final Spec)**

### **This is the mockup that will sit in your hero section and instantly build trust.**

## **1. Mockup Concept**

A **beautiful, modern local business website** that looks like it was designed by a $10k agency.

Should work for ANY local business niche, such as:

* plumbing
* roofing
* HVAC
* realtor
* landscaper
* med spa
* therapist
* cleaning service
* restaurant

The design must feel **clean, aspirational, and obviously premium**.

# 🎨 **2. Mockup Layout Structure**

## **A. Header Bar**

* White background
* Logo placeholder (simple icon + text)
* Nav items (“Services”, “About”, “Contact”)
* Phone number on the right (“(512) 555-0198”)
* Rounded CTA button: “Get a Free Quote”

Professional, clean, local-service style.

## **B. Hero Section (inside the mockup)**

Large, welcoming business-style hero:

### Headline:

```
Fast, Reliable Service You Can Count On.
```

### Subheadline:

```
Proudly serving the Austin area with same-day appointments.
```

### CTA Buttons:

* **Primary:** “Book Now”
* **Secondary:** “See Pricing”

### Background:

* Full-bleed image of:

  * a house exterior (neutral) **OR**
  * a clean work environment
* Slight dark gradient overlay so text is readable
* Rounded 24px corners on the entire hero container

This is the emotional trigger — feels trustworthy and “real.”

---

## **C. Three-Icon Feature Row**

Directly under the hero inside the mockup:

* **Same-Day Service** (clock icon)
* **Locally Owned** (map pin icon)
* **5-Star Rated** (star icon)

Simple, professional, industry-agnostic.

---

## **D. Lower Content Block**

A split layout inside the mockup:

**Left:**

* Image of worker / technician / office team (whichever you prefer)
* Rounded corners, subtle shadow

**Right:**

* Section title: “Why Choose Us?”
* Bullet points:

  * Licensed & insured
  * Affordable pricing
  * Guaranteed satisfaction

This reinforces real-world relevance.

# ✨ **3. AI Automation Overlays (Floating Labels)**

Outside the mockup — these sell the “magic.”

### Floating label 1 (top left):

```
New Page Generated ✓
```

### Floating label 2 (top right):

```
Content Written Today ✓
```

### Floating label 3 (bottom right):

```
SEO Issues Fixed ✓
```

### Floating label 4 (bottom left):

```
Site Improved Daily ✓
```

Each label:

* White background
* Indigo glow
* Rounded 14px corners
* Subtle floating animation (CSS)
* Drop shadow: `rgba(79,70,229,0.18)`

This makes the mockup feel *alive* and *intelligent*.

---

# 🔮 **4. AI Glow Behind Entire Mockup**

A soft radial gradient:

* Center: `rgba(79,70,229,0.15)`
* Outer: transparent
* Blur: 220px
* Width: ~1100px

This positions Arclo as **AI-powered** without feeling sci-fi.

---

# 📦 **5. Export Requirements for Developer**

Your designer will export the mockup as:

### `hero-local-business-mockup.png`

* **Width:** 1200px
* **Height:** ~800px
* Transparent background
* All floating labels included
* AI glow included
* No extra margins

This drops into:

```
/client/src/assets/hero/hero-mockup.png
```

Then your developer displays it with:

```jsx
<img 
  src="/assets/hero/hero-mockup.png"
  alt="Arclo automated local business website"
  className="w-full max-w-[900px] mx-auto mt-12"
>
```
