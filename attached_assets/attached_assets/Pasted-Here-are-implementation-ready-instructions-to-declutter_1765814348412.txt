Here are implementation-ready instructions to declutter the hero by simplifying the value props, tightening the copy, and reducing visual noise while keeping conversion strong.
	1.	Rewrite the hero messaging (new simplified value props)

	•	Replace the current long headline with a single clear outcome + audience:
	•	H1: Automated websites + SEO that keep bringing you customers
	•	Subhead: Launch a modern site in minutes. We continuously fix SEO and publish improvements so your business shows up on Google—without you doing the work.
	•	Replace the 4 long bullets with 3 short “proof-style” value props (max 6–8 words each):
	•	Launch fast
	•	SEO improves every week
	•	Monitoring + alerts included
	•	Add a single “How it works” one-liner under those (optional but recommended):
	•	“Generate your site → we optimize it weekly → you get leads.”

	2.	Reduce the hero content density (layout rules)

	•	Left column must contain only:
	•	H1
	•	1 short subhead (1–2 lines)
	•	3 short value props (not paragraphs)
	•	Primary CTA + secondary CTA
	•	One compact trust row (either “Trusted by 50+ businesses” OR the avatar row, not both)
	•	Remove the extra paragraph under the bullets (“Arclo builds your website…”) from the hero. Move it below the fold into a “Why Arclo” section.

	3.	Simplify CTAs

	•	Keep two CTAs max:
	•	Primary button: “Generate My Free Site”
	•	Secondary link: “See it in action”
	•	Remove the mini footnotes row under CTAs OR reduce to one line max:
	•	Keep: “No credit card required • Cancel anytime”
	•	Remove: “Your site improves daily” (it repeats the value prop)

	4.	Tame the right-side visual (reduce “sticker” clutter)

	•	On the hero mock/screenshot, show at most 2 callouts (not 4):
	•	Keep: “SEO fixes applied” and “New content published”
	•	Remove: “Calls and form fills tracked” and “Pages optimized for keywords” (these can live below the fold)
	•	Ensure callouts don’t overlap each other or the primary focal area of the mock.
	•	Reduce callout prominence:
	•	Lower opacity slightly, reduce padding, and reduce font size.
	•	Remove checkmark icons if present; keep text only.

	5.	Spacing + typography constraints (to enforce “clean”)

	•	Max width for left column text: ~560px.
	•	H1 line count: 2–3 lines max on desktop.
	•	Subhead line count: 2 lines max on desktop.
	•	Value props: one line each, consistent height.
	•	Add more whitespace:
	•	Increase vertical gap between H1/subhead and value props.
	•	Increase gap between value props and CTAs.

	6.	Replace “Built for…” chips (move below fold)

	•	Those chips add clutter in the hero.
	•	Move the “Built for service businesses like…” chip row to the next section below the hero as a horizontal scroller or simple list.

	7.	Exact copy to implement (paste-ready)

	•	H1: Automated websites + SEO that keep bringing you customers
	•	Subhead: Launch a modern site in minutes. We continuously fix SEO and publish improvements so you show up on Google—without lifting a finger.
	•	Value props (3):
	•	Launch fast
	•	SEO improves every week
	•	Monitoring + alerts included
	•	CTA:
	•	Primary: Generate My Free Site
	•	Secondary: See it in action
	•	Trust row (pick one):
	•	Option A: Trusted by 50+ businesses
	•	Option B: Avatar row + “Trusted by 50+ businesses” (but remove any other trust elements)

Acceptance checklist (what “done” looks like)
	•	Hero has 1 headline, 1 subhead, 3 short props, 2 CTAs, 1 trust row.
	•	No paragraphs in the hero besides the subhead.
	•	Right-side mock has max 2 callouts.
	•	Chips moved below the fold.
	•	The hero feels breathable on desktop and doesn’t require scrolling to see CTAs.
