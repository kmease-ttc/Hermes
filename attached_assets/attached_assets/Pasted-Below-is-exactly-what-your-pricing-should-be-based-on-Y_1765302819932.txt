Below is exactly what your pricing should be based on:
	•	Your true costs (≈ $25/mo Replit hosting + $2–$5 API usage)
	•	Market willingness to pay (small biz SEO avg $300–$500/mo)
	•	Your value proof (Empathy Clinic saved $9,000/mo through your system → massive ROI)
	•	Competitors like Arclo, Surfer, DashClicks, Scorpion, Hibu, etc.
	•	The fact that your product is fully autonomous, replaces $500–$2,000/mo SEO retainers, and is “set-it-and-forget-it.”

What you need is three tiers, positioned to maximize conversion AND margin.

⸻

⭐ The Exact Pricing You Should Launch With

1. Starter – $149/month

Purpose: Entry tier to remove friction and capture price-sensitive small businesses.

What’s included:
	•	1 Autonomous Website
	•	Local keyword strategy (Top 50–100 keywords)
	•	Daily automated SEO fixes
	•	Weekly SEO Wave updates
	•	AI-optimized images
	•	Basic analytics
	•	Email support

Why $149/month:
Your cost is ~$27, so margin is excellent, and $149 undercuts cheap agencies ($300–$500/mo) while still feeling “premium enough” to be trusted.

⸻

2. Pro – $299/month (Your Core Plan)

Purpose: This is the plan 70% of customers should pick.
This is where your business model makes money.

What’s included:
	•	Everything in Starter
	•	Up to 3× more pages/topics per month
	•	Top 300–500 keyword strategy
	•	Competitive gap analysis
	•	Advanced content engine (blogs, service pages, landing pages)
	•	Custom schema generation
	•	Priority support
	•	Monthly performance reporting

Why $299/month:
This is the sweet spot in SMB SaaS and aligns with the ROI you deliver.
Every SEO company charging $300–$800/mo delivers WAY less than you.
Your automation allows you to outperform a $1,000/mo SEO retainer → Making $299 feel like a bargain.

This is your “most popular” plan.

⸻

3. Agency / Multi-Site – $99/site/month (minimum 5 sites)

Purpose: Capture agencies, franchises, or multi-location customers.
This is a wholesale plan.

What’s included:
	•	White-label dashboard
	•	Unlimited sites
	•	Client reporting portal
	•	API access
	•	Volume discounts
	•	All Pro features

Pricing structure:
	•	$99/site for 5–25 sites
	•	$79/site for 25+
	•	$49/site for 100+

Why this works:
Agencies need margin.
If they charge their clients $250–$500/mo and pay you $79, you’re irresistible.

⸻

Optional Add-Ons (IMPORTANT for profit)

These should NOT be in the base plans:

AI Blog Booster – $99/month

Auto-publish 4–8 long-form blogs/month.

Google Ads Optimization – $199/month

You have the results to justify this (4× efficiency improvement).
This becomes your high-margin upsell.

Local Reputation AI – $49/month

Coming soon: review monitoring, GBP optimization, citation building.

Backlink Builder Marketplace – pay-as-you-go

You said it yourself: backlinks are the only thing you don’t automate.

⸻

Why These Prices Are Exactly Right

✔ Covers your costs

Your true marginal cost per client: ~$30/mo.
At $149–$299 you maintain 65%–90% margin, which is excellent.

✔ Market anchored

Small biz owners are used to:
	•	$500–$2,000/mo agencies
	•	$1,200 upfront website fees
	•	$300/mo local SEO retainers

You offer all of that for $149–$299.

✔ Perfect value ladder
	•	Starter = removes friction
	•	Pro = the “real product”
	•	Agency = scalable revenue engine

✔ Creates predictable MRR

Your model becomes a subscription machine.

Simple Pricing Table (Copy/Paste for your site)

⸻

If you want to be more aggressive:

Starter → $99/mo

Pro → $199/mo
Agency → $79/site/mo

But this comes with the risk of:
	•	More low-quality customers
	•	Harder to sustain margins

Your screenshots already set the expectation around $149–$299, so stick to it.

⸻

Launch with:

$149 / $299 / $99

This puts you in the exact market sweet spot:
	•	High enough to be trusted

	•	Easy upgrade path
