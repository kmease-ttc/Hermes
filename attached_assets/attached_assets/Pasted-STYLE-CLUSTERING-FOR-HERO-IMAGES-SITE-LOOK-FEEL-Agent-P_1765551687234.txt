STYLE CLUSTERING FOR HERO IMAGES & SITE LOOK/FEEL

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement style clustering so generated sites feel:
	•	cohesive within an industry (professional consistency)
	•	but still unique per business (no template vibes)

This must work for both:
	•	AI-generated hero images
	•	stock hero images
	•	overall site styling (palette + typography + section styling)

Style clustering is not “reuse the same design.”
It is “reuse a style family with variation.”

⸻

PART 1 — Define Style Clusters (Required)

Create a style_clusters registry

Create 8–12 style clusters. Each cluster defines:
	•	cluster_key (e.g. hvac_modern_blue, medical_clean_white, funding_bold_trust)
	•	industries[] it applies to
	•	tone (modern, premium, friendly, rugged, clinical, etc.)
	•	palette (primary, secondary, accent, background)
	•	typography (heading font, body font, sizes scale)
	•	ui_style (button radius, shadow level, card style)
	•	hero_style (photographic direction)
	•	image_prompt_modifiers (short list)
	•	negative_prompt_modifiers (short list)
	•	stock_query_modifiers (short list)

This registry must be config-driven (editable without redeploy).

⸻

PART 2 — Industry → Cluster Selection Logic (Critical)

Cluster selection rules

When generating a site:
	1.	Determine industry and business_type
	2.	Select a cluster using:

	•	a weighted random pick among valid clusters for that industry
	•	prefer clusters that have been used less recently (avoid streaks)

Store on the site:
	•	site.style_cluster_key
	•	site.style_variant_seed (for controlled variation)

This ensures two HVAC sites can share a “family” but not look identical.

⸻

PART 3 — Add Controlled Variation Within a Cluster (Non-Negotiable)

Within a cluster, generate a variant per site using style_variant_seed:

Vary:
	•	accent color shade (within allowed range)
	•	hero overlay gradient strength
	•	section layout variant (choose from 2–3 templates)
	•	icon style set (choose from 2–3 sets)
	•	button style (one of 2 variants)

Rules:
	•	variation must stay within the cluster’s design system
	•	never randomize outside the cluster palette or typography
	•	ensure all variants remain accessible (contrast)

⸻

PART 4 — Apply Clusters to HERO IMAGE GENERATION

AI image generation

When generating hero images:
	•	Base prompt comes from image_intent
	•	Append image_prompt_modifiers from chosen cluster
	•	Append negative_prompt_modifiers

Also enforce:
	•	Generate 3–5 candidates with different seeds
	•	Run uniqueness hash check (existing system)
	•	Select best by relevance + visual quality

Stock image selection

When searching stock:
	•	Use base industry/service query
	•	Append stock_query_modifiers to bias toward cluster look
Example modifiers:
	•	“clean modern”
	•	“natural lighting”
	•	“warm tone”
	•	“minimal”
	•	“high-end”

Run uniqueness check before final selection.

⸻

PART 5 — Apply Clusters to SITE UI (Colors, Typography, Components)

Ensure the cluster controls:
	•	header style
	•	hero typography sizing + contrast overlay rules
	•	CTA button style
	•	card styling
	•	section spacing scale
	•	icon style
	•	background patterns (if any)

All pages must inherit from the chosen cluster:
	•	homepage
	•	services
	•	location pages
	•	contact page

No page should “fall back” to default styling.

⸻

PART 6 — Prevent “Same-Looking” Sites (Guardrails)

Similarity detection (recommended)

Add a lightweight similarity check per cluster:
	•	Track last N hero images + layout variants used per cluster
	•	Avoid choosing the same:
	•	hero composition type
	•	section layout variant
	•	accent shade
	•	icon set
twice in a row for the same industry

This prevents the “it always looks the same” pattern.

⸻

PART 7 — Admin Tools (Required)

Create internal tooling to:
	•	view clusters and their definitions
	•	preview cluster variants (seed-based)
	•	see cluster usage counts
	•	override cluster selection per site
	•	“regenerate in a different style” action for support

⸻

PART 8 — UX Hooks

In the site dashboard:
	•	Display: “Style: Modern (Industry Standard)”
	•	Provide a button (future-ready):
“Try a different style”
This can initially be admin-only.

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Each site is assigned a style cluster and variant seed
	•	Similar industries feel consistent but not identical
	•	Hero images match industry + cluster aesthetic
	•	Repetition is eliminated (no streaks of same look)
	•	A support/admin can re-style a site safely

⸻

Why This Matters

This solves:
	•	“sites look basic”
	•	“sites feel templated”
	•	“images repeat”
without creating:
	•	design chaos
	•	endless customization burden

It’s the sweet spot between “agency quality” and automation.

If you want, next I can write the prompt for:
	•	“regenerate in 3 style options and let the user pick” (high-conversion feature)
