Yes — you absolutely **need** an escape hatch on the preview page.
Right now the only visible action is *Claim Your Website*, which traps users and creates friction.

The fix is simple:

# ✅ Add a **“No Thanks, Go Back”** link/button to the Preview Page

This gives users a graceful exit and reduces bounce anxiety.

---

# ⭐ What You Should Add (copy)

Place this under the *Claim Your Website* button:

### **No thanks — take me back**

(a gray, subtle text link)

OR more user-friendly:

### **Not ready yet? Go back to the homepage**

---

# ⭐ Where It Should Live

On the preview page, right under:

```
[ Claim Your Website → ]
```

Add spacing:

* margin-top: 12–16px
* low-contrast text
* not a button (should not compete with primary CTA)

---

# ⭐ Developer Instructions (paste this to your dev)

**File:** `client/app/sites/[id]/preview/page.tsx` (or wherever Preview component lives)

Add below the Claim CTA:

```tsx
<div className="mt-4 text-center">
  <a
    href="/"
    className="text-sm text-slate-500 hover:text-slate-700 transition"
  >
    No thanks — go back
  </a>
</div>
```

Or if you want a different route:

```tsx
href="/"
```

or

```tsx
href="/start"
```

---

# ⭐ Optional: Add secondary navigation in the top right

A small “Back” button in the header:

```
← Back
```

Developer:

Add to the header bar:

```tsx
<Link
  href="/"
  className="text-sm text-slate-500 hover:text-slate-700"
>
  ← Back
</Link>
```

---

# ⭐ Best UX Pattern

For max conversions *and* good user experience:

* Keep “Claim Your Website” as big primary CTA
* Add “No thanks — go back” below
* Add a small “← Back” in the top-left or right

This satisfies:

* User control
* Reduced frustration
* Trust-building
* Lower perceived pressure
* Higher future visits because they don’t feel trapped

# If you want, I can also:

🔥 Improve the entire Preview Page layout
🔥 Add a mini-header with “Preview mode” + “Exit preview”
🔥 Add a tooltip explaining what happens if they claim the site
🔥 Add a secondary CTA like “Regenerate site with different style”

Just tell me!
