You’re exactly right: the “magic moment” is the first view. If the hero is missing (gray block), the spell breaks.

This is a classic “preview is shown before required assets are ready” problem + missing real-time refresh. Fix it by making hero/logo blocking for the first render, then optionally doing background upgrades later.

Below is a clean write-up + a prompt you can give your agent/dev to fix it.

⸻

What’s happening
	•	You render the preview page as soon as the site config/deploy exists.
	•	Hero image generation finishes after that.
	•	The site eventually updates, but:
	•	the user sees an ugly first impression
	•	the UI doesn’t auto-refresh, so they must reload

So the system is technically working, but the experience is not.

⸻

What we should do (your philosophy)
	1.	Do not show the preview until the hero is ready (hero is the “magic moment”).
	2.	No manual refresh — the page must update automatically when hero is available.
	3.	If it takes longer, that’s fine: better to wait 10–20 seconds and wow them, than show an incomplete site fast.

⸻

The Fix (high-level)

A) Add a Preview Readiness Gate

Create “minimum viable magic” requirements for showing the preview:

Preview is only shown when:
	•	hero image URL exists AND is verified reachable
	•	logo exists (generated or clean fallback wordmark)
	•	site has been deployed with those asset URLs

Until then, show a progress card.

B) Always Poll + Auto-swap into Preview

The waiting screen should:
	•	poll job status every 2–3 seconds
	•	the moment hero+logo are ready and deployed, automatically transition to the preview (no reload)

C) Separate “blocking” assets from “nice-to-have”

Blocking for first view:
	•	hero image
	•	logo (or wordmark fallback)

Can be background upgrades:
	•	secondary section images
	•	icon packs
	•	additional blog images

UX copy for the wait screen (simple + confident)

Title: Finishing your preview…
Subtitle: Generating your hero image and logo so your site looks great from the first second.
Progress bullets:
	•	Writing your website content
	•	Creating your hero image
	•	Creating your logo
	•	Finalizing your preview

This makes waiting feel intentional, not broken.

Prompt for your agent/dev (copy/paste)

PROMPT: Block Preview Until Hero Image is Ready + Auto-Refresh Without Reload

We have a UX issue: the preview page loads before the hero image is ready, so users see a gray/placeholder hero at first. The hero eventually appears, but only after a manual refresh. This kills the “magic moment.”

Fix this so users never see an incomplete preview.

Requirements:
	1.	Define “Preview Ready” correctly:

	•	A preview must not be shown until the hero image is generated and available (valid URL).
	•	Logo must also be present (generated logo or a clean wordmark fallback).
	•	Do not label anything “Preview Ready” until these are true.

	2.	Add a preview readiness gate:

	•	The Results/Preview page should display a progress/wait screen until hero + logo are ready and the preview deploy has those assets.
	•	If hero generation takes longer, that’s acceptable—prefer waiting slightly longer over showing placeholders.

	3.	Eliminate manual refresh:

	•	The page must poll status (every 2–3 seconds).
	•	When hero/logo become available, automatically switch from the wait screen to the preview view without requiring reload.

	4.	Separate blocking vs non-blocking assets:

	•	Blocking: hero image + logo (or wordmark fallback).
	•	Non-blocking: secondary section images and optional upgrades can continue in background after preview is visible.

	5.	Add validation:

	•	Confirm hero image URL is reachable before rendering the preview.
	•	If image generation fails after retries, use a curated industry fallback hero image so the preview still looks complete (never gray).

	6.	QA checklist:

	•	User never sees a gray hero on first view.
	•	Preview appears only once hero is present.
	•	No manual refresh needed for hero/logo to show.
	•	Works consistently across industries.

Deliver:
	•	Summary of what caused the placeholder first render
	•	The new state machine/status fields used
	•	Confirmation with a test run showing preview only appears once hero is ready

If you want one extra improvement: once you do this, the perceived speed still feels fast if you show the wait screen with steps and it transitions smoothly. The user will interpret it as “wow, it’s building something real,” not “it’s slow.”
