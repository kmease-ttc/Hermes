Perfect — here’s a clean, implementation-ready agent prompt plus a clear domain provider recommendation and pricing decision that won’t bite you later.

I’m going to optimize for:
	•	lowest engineering friction
	•	lowest customer confusion
	•	fastest “site live” moment
	•	zero DNS support tickets if possible

⸻

1. Domain Provider Recommendation (pick this)

Use Porkbun as the primary domain provider

Why Porkbun is the right choice for Arclo right now:
	•	Simple REST API (no enterprise nonsense)
	•	Clean DNS model (A, CNAME, ALIAS supported)
	•	Low wholesale pricing (customers trust pricing)
	•	Free WHOIS privacy (huge trust signal)
	•	No dark patterns or upsells (important for SMB trust)
	•	Very reliable DNS propagation

Alternatives and why not:
	•	GoDaddy: support nightmare, brand distrust, upsell hell
	•	Namecheap: fine, but API + DNS flows are clunkier
	•	Google Domains: deprecated / migrating → risk
	•	Cloudflare Registrar: great later, harder first integration

Verdict: Porkbun is the fastest path to “it just works”.

⸻

2. Domain Pricing Decision (important)

Should you add a premium?

Yes — but small, transparent, and value-anchored.

You are not selling a domain.
You are selling:
	•	zero setup
	•	zero DNS steps
	•	zero registrar confusion
	•	instant publish

Recommended pricing model

Customer sees:
	•	Domain price: $15–$20 / year (most .coms)
	•	“Managed Domain Setup” fee: $24/year

Total: ~$39–$44/year

Why this works
	•	$2/month is psychologically nothing
	•	Covers support + automation costs
	•	Justifies “we handle everything”
	•	Still dramatically cheaper than agencies

What NOT to do
	•	Don’t hide markup
	•	Don’t inflate domain price
	•	Don’t charge monthly for domain management

Copy that works

“Includes domain registration, privacy protection, DNS setup, and ongoing management.”

3. Agent Prompt — Domain + Publish Workflow

This is the exact prompt to give your Replit Agent.

You can paste this as-is.

⸻

Agent Prompt: Domain & Publish Workflow (Greenfield First)

You are implementing the primary “Greenfield” domain and publishing workflow for Arclo.

Core Principles
	•	Users must see a full site preview before any account, payment, or domain steps.
	•	Domain setup must feel completely done-for-them.
	•	The default path assumes the user does NOT own a domain.
	•	Existing-domain users are handled in a secondary workflow later.

⸻

Step 1: Preview → Publish Gate

When a user clicks “Publish My Site” from the preview page:
	•	Require account creation (email/password or Google).
	•	Do NOT collect payment yet.
	•	Persist the generated site as a draft tied to the account.

⸻

Step 2: Plan + Add-Ons

After account creation:
	•	Show base plan selection.
	•	Show add-ons as checkboxes.
	•	Display live-updating monthly total.
	•	CTA: “Continue to Domain Setup”.

⸻

Step 3: Domain Ownership Question

Prompt the user:

“Do you already own a domain?”

Options:
	•	“No, help me get one” (default, primary)
	•	“Yes, I already own one” (secondary; stub for now)

⸻

Step 4A: No Domain → Domain Search

For users without a domain:
	•	Provide a domain search input.
	•	Auto-suggest domains based on:
	•	business name
	•	city
	•	service
	•	Show:
	•	availability
	•	annual price
	•	note: “Includes privacy + DNS setup”

Allow the user to select a domain.

⸻

Step 5: Domain Registration (Porkbun)

When a domain is selected:
	•	Use Porkbun API to:
	•	Register domain under the customer’s account reference.
	•	Enable WHOIS privacy.
	•	Configure DNS automatically:
	•	Root A/ALIAS → Arclo hosting
	•	www → root
	•	Store domain ownership metadata.

The user should not be shown DNS records or registrar details.

⸻

Step 6: Checkout

Single checkout including:
	•	Monthly plan + add-ons
	•	Domain cost (annual)
	•	Managed Domain Setup fee ($24/year)

Display line items clearly.

⸻

Step 7: Go Live

After successful payment:
	•	Deploy site to the purchased domain.
	•	Verify DNS resolution.
	•	Show confirmation screen:
	•	“Your site is live”
	•	Domain status: Live
	•	Services active

Redirect user to dashboard.

⸻

Step 8: Dashboard Domain Status

In the dashboard:
	•	Show domain name
	•	Show status: Live / Propagating
	•	Provide reassurance copy:
	•	“DNS can take up to 24 hours, but most sites are live within minutes.”

Do NOT expose registrar credentials.

⸻

Technical Notes
	•	Domain provider: Porkbun
	•	Domain pricing: pass-through + $24/year managed setup
	•	DNS automation is mandatory
	•	No Replit URLs should ever be customer-visible

⸻

4. Strategic Notes (for you, not the agent)

This setup gives you:
	•	Instant “wow” moment
	•	Minimal support tickets
	•	Clean upsell path
	•	Easy future agency/multi-domain expansion

Later you can:
	•	Add Cloudflare in front for performance
	•	Offer “bring your own domain” with guided DNS
	•	Bundle domains for agency plans
