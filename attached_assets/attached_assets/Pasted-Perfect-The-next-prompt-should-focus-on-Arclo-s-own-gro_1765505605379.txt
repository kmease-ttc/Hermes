Perfect. The next prompt should focus on Arclo’s own growth engine — using the product itself to generate demand.

At this stage, Arclo is good enough that examples should sell it. You should stop relying on abstract value props and start letting real generated sites, industries, and before/after transformations drive inbound traffic and conversions.

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Arclo SEO, Examples & Programmatic Growth

Agent Prompt

Objective

Turn Arclo into its own best marketing channel by:
	•	showcasing real generated sites
	•	creating industry- and city-specific example pages
	•	using before/after transformations as proof
	•	building an SEO engine powered by Arclo’s own capabilities

This work should produce compounding inbound traffic and higher-quality leads.

⸻

PART 1 — Public Examples Gallery (Critical)

Create an “Examples” Section on the Marketing Site

URL:
/examples

Each example should include:
	•	Industry
	•	City / region
	•	Screenshot of generated site
	•	Short explanation:
“Generated in minutes, customized over time”

Rules:
	•	Use real generated sites (anonymized if needed)
	•	No fake demos
	•	Keep copy minimal and outcome-focused

⸻

PART 2 — Industry-Specific Example Pages (High SEO Value)

Generate pages like:
	•	/examples/hvac
	•	/examples/plumbing
	•	/examples/roofing
	•	/examples/funding
	•	/examples/medical
	•	/examples/legal

Each page must include:
	•	3–5 example sites
	•	Common needs for that industry
	•	How Arclo handles them automatically
	•	Clear CTA: “Generate your free site”

Avoid jargon. Focus on familiarity.

⸻

PART 3 — City + Industry Programmatic Pages (Optional, Powerful)

Generate pages like:
	•	/examples/hvac/san-marcos-tx
	•	/examples/plumber/austin-tx

These pages should:
	•	Pull from existing examples
	•	Adjust copy for city/industry
	•	Be indexable
	•	Avoid duplication penalties (vary content)

This mirrors what Arclo does for customers — dogfooding the platform.

⸻

PART 4 — Before/After Proof Integration

On every example page:
	•	Include at least one before/after transformation
	•	Short caption:
“After two updates: new services, better layout, clearer calls to action”

This visually reinforces:
	•	customization
	•	ongoing value
	•	managed service positioning

⸻

PART 5 — SEO Foundations (Must-Have)

Ensure:
	•	Clean URLs
	•	Proper H1/H2 usage
	•	Schema for:
	•	SoftwareApplication
	•	Examples / Case studies
	•	Internal linking between:
	•	Pricing
	•	Examples
	•	Industries
	•	Blog (future)

No keyword stuffing.

⸻

PART 6 — Conversion Hooks (Important)

Every example page should include:
	•	Sticky CTA:
“Generate your free site”
	•	Secondary CTA:
“See how updates work”

Do NOT push pricing first.

⸻

PART 7 — Admin / Content Controls

Add internal tooling to:
	•	Approve examples
	•	Tag by industry and city
	•	Hide low-quality examples
	•	Rotate featured examples

No full CMS required — config-driven is fine.

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Arclo has a real examples gallery
	•	Industry pages exist and convert
	•	SEO pages are indexable and scalable
	•	Product examples sell the product
	•	Arclo practices what it preaches

⸻

Why This Is the Right Next Step

You’ve already built:
	•	a generator
	•	customization
	•	proof
	•	trust

Now you turn that into:

“Show me one like my business”

Which is the highest-converting sales motion you can have.

⸻

After this, the final major workstreams will be:
	1.	White-label / reseller mode
	2.	Integrations (CRM, Zapier, GSC API, GA4 API)
	3.	Enterprise / multi-location support

When you’re ready, say which one and I’ll write that prompt.
