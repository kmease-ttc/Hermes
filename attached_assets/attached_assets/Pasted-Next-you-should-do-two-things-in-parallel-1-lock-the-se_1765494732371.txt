Next, you should do two things in parallel: (1) lock the “service model” into code so upsells actually work, and (2) add the first 2–3 automated setup flows that remove the biggest friction (Search Console + Analytics + Domain).

Here are the exact next-step instructions to give the agent.

Next Step Instructions — Make Services Real + Implement First Setup Flows

Objective

Turn the “Available Services” list into a working subscription system, and implement the first real “done-for-you” setup flows so you can sell them immediately.

This work should result in:
	•	A real service catalog in the database
	•	Per-site entitlements (what’s active vs available)
	•	A purchase/subscribe action that changes what runs + what displays
	•	First “assisted setup” workflow that is operational (even if partially manual behind the scenes)

⸻

PART A — Build the Service Catalog + Entitlements (Required)

1) Create Data Model

Create tables (or collections) to support services:
	1.	services

	•	id
	•	key (string, unique, e.g. gsc_setup, ga4_setup, blog_monthly)
	•	name
	•	description_short
	•	description_long
	•	category (setup | seo | content | visibility | conversion)
	•	billing_type (one_time | monthly | yearly)
	•	price_cents
	•	is_active (bool)
	•	sort_order (int)
	•	prerequisites (json array of service keys)
	•	default_frequency (json: { cadence: weekly/monthly, etc. })

	2.	site_service_subscriptions

	•	id
	•	site_id
	•	service_key
	•	status (active | canceled | pending | trial)
	•	start_date
	•	end_date (nullable)
	•	billing_provider (stripe)
	•	billing_id (nullable)
	•	metadata (json)

	3.	site_tasks

	•	id
	•	site_id
	•	service_key
	•	task_key
	•	status (queued | running | completed | failed | blocked)
	•	scheduled_for
	•	completed_at
	•	output_summary
	•	output_metadata (json)

2) Seed Initial Services

Seed at minimum these services with real pricing:

Setup (one-time):
	•	launch_setup_assist — $149 one-time (bundle: GSC + GA4 + verification + sitemap submit)
	•	gsc_setup — $79 one-time
	•	ga4_setup — $79 one-time
	•	domain_purchase_setup — $24/year managed domain setup (paired with domain cost pass-through)

Ongoing (monthly):
	•	technical_seo — $49/mo
	•	blog_monthly — $99/mo (4 posts/month)
	•	location_pages — $79/mo
	•	rank_tracking — $19/mo

(These can be adjusted later; implement as config.)

3) Entitlement Logic

Implement backend logic:
	•	“Active Services” = all subscriptions where status=active for that site
	•	“Available Services” = all services not active + eligible (prerequisites satisfied)
	•	If prerequisites not met, show locked state with text: “Requires X”

⸻

PART B — Wire the UI to Real Subscribe/Add Actions (Required)

1) Service Cards

Each service card in “Available Services” must have:
	•	price
	•	billing type
	•	CTA:
	•	“Add” for one-time
	•	“Subscribe” for monthly/yearly

2) Clicking CTA

On click:
	•	Create checkout session (Stripe) OR create a “pending” record if Stripe isn’t wired yet
	•	On success:
	•	create site_service_subscriptions record status=active
	•	generate initial site_tasks entries for that service (if applicable)
	•	refresh UI so it moves from “Available” to “Active”

3) For now, if Stripe is not ready

Implement a temporary “Manual purchase mode” behind an admin flag:
	•	Clicking “Add” creates subscription as pending
	•	UI shows: “We’ll email you to complete setup”
	•	Still creates a task checklist for internal execution

⸻

PART C — Implement the First “Assisted Setup” Flow (GSC + GA4)

1) Add “Assisted Setup” CTA

On the Launch Checklist steps:
	•	“Connect Google Search Console”
	•	“Connect Analytics”
Add button:
	•	“Have Arclo do this for me”

Clicking it should:
	•	add launch_setup_assist (bundle) OR add the specific service
	•	open checkout (or set pending in manual mode)
	•	create tasks with required inputs

2) Required Inputs Collection UI

Add a small modal form for the setup tasks:

For Google Search Console:
	•	Google account email they want to use for ownership (or “use Arclo-managed account”)
	•	Confirmation checkbox: “I authorize Arclo to set this up for my business”

For GA4:
	•	Same Google account email
	•	If they already have GA4: property ID (optional)

3) Task Execution (Phase 1)

Phase 1 can be partially manual, but must be structured:
	•	Create site_tasks:
	•	gsc_create_property
	•	gsc_verify_domain
	•	gsc_submit_sitemap
	•	ga4_create_property
	•	ga4_install_tag
	•	ga4_verify_events

Add an internal admin view to mark each task complete and store notes.

⸻

PART D — Improve “Publish” Flow Tie-in (Small but Important)

1) Make “Publish your website” depend on required launch steps only

Required:
	•	business info
	•	primary services
	•	service areas
	•	domain connected

Not required:
	•	GSC
	•	Analytics

2) After publish, show next recommended actions

If not connected:
	•	show “Recommended: Connect GSC” + “Have Arclo do it for $79”

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Service catalog exists + seeded
	•	Active vs Available services show correctly per site
	•	Subscribing adds entitlements and changes UI immediately
	•	Assisted setup creates structured tasks and captures required inputs
	•	Launch checklist uses the new logic and stays clean
