Great instinct. This is mostly a positioning + guardrails problem, not a technical one. You want to:
	•	remove the “this is basic / locked” fear
	•	signal flexibility and power
	•	avoid opening yourself up to unlimited chaos
	•	keep the promise simple and believable

Here’s the recommendation, then the agent prompt.

⸻

First: My Recommendation (Decision)

Do not position this as “number of updates”

Counting updates is:
	•	confusing
	•	arbitrary
	•	invites gaming (“does this count as one?”)
	•	makes the product feel cheap/transactional

Instead, position it as response-based customization, with SLAs and scope, not counts.

The mental model that works best

You are not selling “pages.”
You are selling:

“Tell us what you want changed, and we’ll do it for you.”

That’s powerful, reassuring, and aligns with how you’ll actually operate.

⸻

The Right Model (Simple, Honest, Scalable)

Base Plan: “Managed Website”

Includes:
	•	Hosting
	•	Ongoing maintenance
	•	Minor copy/layout tweaks
	•	Bug fixes
	•	Small adjustments

Limits (important, but soft):
	•	“Reasonable changes”
	•	No design overhauls
	•	No net-new complex features

Positioning:
“Perfect if you want a professional site that stays up to date.”

⸻

Pro Plan: “Unlimited Updates”

This is where you unlock the promise you want to make.

Includes:
	•	Unlimited content updates
	•	Layout changes
	•	Section swaps
	•	New pages
	•	Copy rewrites
	•	Visual adjustments

Rules:
	•	Requests are handled asynchronously
	•	Turnaround: within 24 hours
	•	One request at a time per site (this is the real throttle)

Positioning:
“Tell us what you want. We’ll make it happen.”

This avoids:
	•	abuse
	•	giant backlogs
	•	unclear scope

⸻

What “Unlimited” Means (in plain English)

You should define it as:

“Unlimited requests, handled one at a time, completed within 24 hours.”

This is the same model used by:
	•	design subscription companies
	•	dev-as-a-service companies

It works.

⸻

How to Communicate This on the Landing Page

You don’t need to show pricing yet. You need to remove fear.

Add a section titled:

“You’re not locked into the first version”

Copy (example):
“You can update anything on your site — text, layout, sections, pages, or services. Just tell us what you want, and we’ll handle the changes for you.”

Then:
	•	“Most updates are completed within 24 hours.”
	•	“No code. No editors. No hassle.”

This reframes “basic” as “starting point.”

⸻

Now: The Agent Prompt

Below is the exact prompt to give the agent.

⸻

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Customization Model & Messaging

Agent Prompt

Objective

Clearly communicate that Arclo-generated sites are fully customizable after signup, and implement a simple, scalable update-request model tied to plans.

This work focuses on:
	•	messaging
	•	plan semantics
	•	update request flow (lightweight)
	•	trust and reassurance

Do NOT build a complex CMS or editor.

⸻

PART 1 — Define the Update Model (Required)

Introduce Two Update Tiers

Tier 1: Managed Updates (Base Plan)
Includes:
	•	Minor copy changes
	•	Small layout adjustments
	•	Bug fixes
	•	Content corrections

Rules:
	•	No hard numeric limits
	•	Framed as “reasonable changes”
	•	No SLA guarantee beyond “best effort”

Used for:
	•	fixing typos
	•	adjusting text
	•	small visual tweaks

⸻

Tier 2: Unlimited Updates (Pro Add-On or Higher Plan)
Includes:
	•	Unlimited update requests
	•	One request active at a time
	•	Turnaround target: within 24 hours

Requests can include:
	•	New pages
	•	Section redesigns
	•	Copy rewrites
	•	Layout changes
	•	Visual updates

Explicitly exclude:
	•	Custom app development
	•	Net-new product features
	•	Third-party integrations (unless sold separately)

⸻

PART 2 — Landing Page Messaging (Critical)

Add a new section to the marketing site.

Section Title

“You’re never locked into the first version”

Required Copy Themes
	•	You can change anything
	•	Just tell us what you want
	•	We handle the updates
	•	Updates publish fast (24 hours)

Avoid:
	•	mentioning limits
	•	mentioning “AI”
	•	technical language

⸻

PART 3 — Pricing Page Language Update

On plans/add-ons, include a row:

“Website updates & customization”

Base plan:
	•	“Managed updates”

Pro / Unlimited:
	•	“Unlimited updates, handled for you”

Add footnote:
“Requests handled one at a time. Most updates completed within 24 hours.”

⸻

PART 4 — Add a Lightweight Update Request Flow

UI Entry Point

Add a button in the site dashboard:
“Request a change”

Flow
	1.	Simple text input:
“What would you like to change?”
	2.	Optional:
	•	reference URL/section
	3.	Submit

Behavior
	•	Create a request record tied to the site
	•	Mark status:
	•	queued
	•	in progress
	•	completed
	•	Only allow one active request at a time for Unlimited plan
	•	Base plan users can submit but may see slower handling

No editor. No previews. Keep it simple.

⸻

PART 5 — Tie Updates to Activity Feed

When a request is:
	•	received → activity created
	•	completed → activity created with summary

Example:
“Updated homepage copy and added new service section.”

This reinforces value.

⸻

PART 6 — UX Rules
	•	Never imply the site is “finished”
	•	Never imply users must edit themselves
	•	Never expose internal limits
	•	Emphasize partnership, not tooling

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Users understand they can customize freely
	•	“Basic-looking” no longer feels risky
	•	Update expectations are clear
	•	Scope is controlled without friction
	•	Messaging builds confidence

⸻

Why This Is the Right Next Step

This directly addresses the biggest psychological blocker:

“What if this doesn’t quite fit my business?”

You’re answering it with:

“That’s fine. We’ll change it for you.”

Which is exactly what people want to hear.

⸻

If you want, the next logical step after this would be:
	•	A request intake + internal workflow view, or
	•	A before/after gallery to visually prove customization

Say which one and I’ll write that prompt.
