The 4 Suggested Steps (Clean & Actionable)

Step 1 — Create the first core blog posts
Write the initial set of high-quality blog posts that:
	•	Target Arclo’s core keyword themes
	•	Use proper blog best practices (H1/H2, internal links, tags, meta)
	•	Are written for non-technical small business owners
	•	Cross-link to each other

Step 2 — Generate the keyword map (internal)
Create and store Arclo’s top ~100 keyword list, clustered by theme, and map which blogs support which clusters.

Step 3 — Add images and image prompts
Generate a featured image + supporting images for each blog using consistent, industry-relevant prompts and proper alt text.

Step 4 — Turn the blog into a ranking system
Create hub-and-spoke internal linking, a publishing cadence, and rules so every new blog strengthens existing ones.

Most local business owners don’t care about “SEO.”
They care about one thing: customers finding them.

If you’ve ever wondered why some businesses show up everywhere on Google while others don’t, the answer is simpler than it sounds.

How Google Finds Your Business
Google looks for three main things:
	•	What you do
	•	Where you do it
	•	Whether your website is clear and up to date

If your site makes those things obvious, Google sends customers your way.

Why Most Websites Don’t Show Up
Most small business websites fail because:
	•	They only talk about the business once
	•	They don’t clearly list services
	•	They don’t mention service areas
	•	They never get updated

That makes it hard for Google to understand who should see the site.

What Actually Works
Businesses that show up on Google usually have:
	•	Pages for each service they offer
	•	Pages for the cities or areas they serve
	•	Clear contact information
	•	Content that gets updated over time

This is exactly what Arclo builds and maintains automatically.

The Easiest Way to Get Found
You don’t need to manage keywords or learn SEO tools.

You need a website that:
	•	Clearly explains what you do
	•	Clearly shows where you work
	•	Keeps improving over time

Arclo handles all of that for you.

Content

If your website only has a homepage and an “About” page, you’re invisible to most customers.

What Is a Service Page?
A service page explains one thing you do.

For example:
	•	Air Conditioning Repair
	•	Heating Installation
	•	Emergency HVAC Service

Each page gives Google and customers a clear answer to what you offer.

Why They Matter
When someone searches “AC repair near me,” Google looks for a page that clearly matches that service.

If your site doesn’t have one, you don’t show up.

Common Mistake
Many businesses list services in a bullet list on the homepage.
That’s not enough.

Google wants clear, focused pages.

How Arclo Handles This
Arclo:
	•	Builds pages for every service you offer
	•	Writes the content for you
	•	Keeps those pages updated automatically

You don’t need to think about it — customers just find you.

Content

Most customers don’t just search for a service — they search for a service near them.

What Are Location Pages?
Location pages explain where you work.

Examples:
	•	HVAC Services in San Marcos
	•	Plumbing Services in Austin
	•	AC Repair in New Braunfels

Each page tells Google and customers that you serve that area.

Why They Work
Google wants to show results that are:
	•	Relevant
	•	Nearby
	•	Clear

Location pages make all three obvious.

Why Businesses Miss This
Most business owners don’t have time to:
	•	Write dozens of pages
	•	Keep them updated
	•	Make sure they’re accurate

So they skip it.

How Arclo Solves This
Arclo automatically:
	•	Creates pages for the cities you serve
	•	Keeps them updated
	•	Expands them over time as your business grows

Getting website visitors is useless if no one calls you.

Common Reasons Websites Don’t Convert
	•	No clear “Call Now” button
	•	Contact info buried at the bottom
	•	Confusing layout
	•	Generic content that doesn’t build trust

Customers leave instead of calling.

What Customers Need
Visitors want:
	•	To know you offer what they need
	•	To trust you
	•	To contact you quickly

If that’s not obvious in the first few seconds, they’re gone.

How Arclo Fixes This
Arclo:
	•	Adds clear call-to-action buttons
	•	Makes phone numbers easy to tap
	•	Structures pages so customers know what to do next
