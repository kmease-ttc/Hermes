This is a great instinct, and it fits Arclo’s philosophy perfectly:

“You don’t edit your website — you tell us what you want and we handle it.”

The key is to make feedback feel:
	•	effortless
	•	safe
	•	non-technical
	•	fast (“a couple of hours” is a huge trust lever)

Below is:
	1.	The right conceptual model (so it stays clean)
	2.	A simple UX pattern that won’t clutter the page
	3.	The backend workflow you want
	4.	A single prompt you can give your dev/agent to implement it

⸻

1. The Right Model (Important)

You do NOT want:
	•	inline editing
	•	lots of form fields
	•	“CMS-like” controls
	•	users thinking they are now responsible for the site

You DO want:
	•	“Request a change”
	•	“Leave feedback”
	•	“Tell us what to tweak”

Think of this as:

GitHub Issues for your website — but invisible to the user.

They describe intent, not implementation.

⸻

2. Where This Lives (Clean UX)

Add ONE subtle action near the preview

On the Results / Preview page, near the CTA area, add a secondary link:

“Request a change”
(or)
“Want something tweaked?”

This should:
	•	be visible
	•	but clearly secondary to Launch My Website
	•	not compete with conversion

Example placement:
	•	Under the primary CTA
	•	Or as a small text link below “Preview Ready”

⸻

3. The Feedback UI (Keep It Dead Simple)

Clicking “Request a change” opens a small modal or side panel.

Modal contents (that’s it):

Title:
“Tell us what you’d like changed”

Body copy:

Want something tweaked? Just tell us what you want and we’ll handle it.
Most changes are done within a couple of hours.

Single input field:
	•	Multiline text box
	•	Placeholder:
“For example: change the headline, swap the hero image, add a service, adjust wording…”

Optional (but nice):
	•	Dropdown: “What type of change?”
	•	Text
	•	Images
	•	Services
	•	Layout
	•	Something else

Submit button:
“Send request”

No more than this.

⸻

4. What Happens After They Submit (Critical for Trust)

Immediately after submit, show:

Success message:

Got it! We’ll take a look and update your site shortly.
Most changes are completed within a couple of hours.

Optional:
	•	“We’ll email you when it’s done.”

This closes the loop.

⸻

5. Backend Workflow (How You Actually Handle It)

Create a simple Change Request object.

Fields to store:
	•	requestId
	•	siteId
	•	userId
	•	requestText
	•	requestType (optional)
	•	status:
	•	submitted
	•	in_progress
	•	completed
	•	createdAt
	•	completedAt

Operational flow:
	1.	User submits feedback
	2.	You get notified (Slack/email)
	3.	You or the agent update the site
	4.	Mark request as completed
	5.	Optional: send email
“Your update is live.”

This scales cleanly and keeps users out of the weeds.

⸻

6. Why This Works (Product-wise)

This:
	•	reinforces “done-for-you”
	•	removes fear (“what if it’s not perfect?”)
	•	increases conversion at preview
	•	avoids building a full editor
	•	matches your couple hours turnaround promise

Psychologically, it says:

“You’re not locked in — we’ll adjust it for you.”

That’s huge.

⸻

7. Prompt for Your Developer / Agent (Copy/Paste)

Here’s the exact prompt.

⸻

PROMPT: Add Simple Feedback / Change Request Flow to Preview Page

We need to let users request changes to their site in a clean, non-technical way.

Goals
	•	Allow users to submit feedback or change requests
	•	Keep the UX simple and confidence-inspiring
	•	Reinforce that Arclo handles updates for them
	•	Avoid exposing editing tools or CMS-style controls

⸻

Part 1 — Frontend UX

On the Results / Preview page:
	•	Add a secondary action link:
“Request a change” or “Want something tweaked?”
	•	Place it below or near the primary CTA (“Launch My Website”).

Clicking the link opens a modal or side panel.

Modal contents:
	•	Title: “Tell us what you’d like changed”
	•	Short reassurance text:
“Just tell us what you want — we’ll take care of it. Most changes are done within a couple of hours.”
	•	One multiline text input for the request
	•	Optional dropdown for request type (text, images, services, layout, other)
	•	Submit button: “Send request”

After submission:
	•	Show confirmation message
	•	Do not navigate away
	•	Optionally mention email confirmation

⸻

Part 2 — Backend

Create a ChangeRequest entity with:
	•	siteId
	•	userId
	•	requestText
	•	requestType
	•	status (submitted / in_progress / completed)
	•	timestamps

On submit:
	•	Save the request
	•	Notify admins (Slack/email)
	•	Associate the request with the site

Provide a simple admin view to:
	•	see pending requests
	•	mark them complete
	•	optionally add internal notes

⸻

Part 3 — Trust & Messaging

Do NOT:
	•	Show a complex editor
	•	Expose technical options
	•	Make users feel responsible for implementation

DO:
	•	Emphasize speed (“a couple of hours”)
	•	Emphasize ease (“just tell us”)
	•	Reinforce done-for-you positioning

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	Users can submit feedback in under 10 seconds
	•	No page reloads required
	•	Confirmation is immediate
	•	Requests are clearly tied to a site
	•	This does not distract from the primary “Launch My Website” CTA

⸻

8. Optional (Later, Not Now)

Later enhancements you can add:
	•	Show a small badge: “1 update pending”
	•	Let users see request history
	•	Allow follow-up comments

But do not block launch on those.

⸻

Bottom line

This is exactly the right feature:
	•	small
	•	high trust
	•	high conversion impact
	•	aligned with your philosophy

You’re not building an editor — you’re building confidence.

If you want, next I can help you:
	•	write the exact microcopy for the modal
	•	design the admin-side “requests” view
	•	decide when to surface this (before vs after launch)

Just tell me.
