Perfect timing to do this.
Below is a clean, opinionated launch checklist, ordered by impact, not by effort. This is meant to be practical — if you check these boxes, you’re ready to ship and learn from real users.

I’ve split it into Must-Have Before Launch, Strongly Recommended, and Post-Launch (Do Not Block Launch) so you don’t overbuild.

ARCLO LAUNCH CHECKLIST

✅ MUST-HAVE BEFORE LAUNCH (Non-Negotiable)

These directly affect conversion, trust, or data quality.

⸻

1. One Clear Primary Action Everywhere

Status: Must be true on homepage, pricing, preview pages.
	•	Primary CTA is consistent:
	•	“Generate My Free Site” / “Create My Site”
	•	No competing CTAs at the same visual level.
	•	User always understands:
	•	“If I click this, Arclo builds my site for me.”

If a user hesitates, they should still know what to do next.

⸻

2. “What Happens Next” Is Obvious

Add a simple 3-step explainer near the main CTA.

Example (language can vary):
	1.	Tell us about your business
	2.	We build and improve your website automatically
	3.	More customers find and contact you

This removes anxiety and increases clicks.

⸻

3. Preview Quality Gate Is Enforced

Do not ship if this is flaky.

Before a preview is shown:
	•	Hero image matches the industry
	•	Logo exists (generated or clean wordmark)
	•	Preview iframe = new tab preview (same build)
	•	Header does not overlap content
	•	CTA to claim/purchase is visible above the fold
	•	No global hard-coded colors (e.g., purple pills)

This is your first impression engine.

⸻

4. Pricing Page Is Honest + Simple

Confirm:
	•	Prices are correct everywhere
	•	Grow plan is visually dominant
	•	Each add-on has a short value statement (why it matters)
	•	No technical jargon exposed
	•	“Cancel anytime / preview before paying” is visible

You don’t need more plans. You need clarity.

⸻

5. Existing Website Flow Works End-to-End

Test this path explicitly:
	1.	Enter existing website URL
	2.	Audit runs
	3.	Preview generated
	4.	Preview looks correct
	5.	Clear CTA to “Have Arclo do this” / Claim site

This is your best acquisition wedge.

⸻

6. Analytics Are Firing

You must be able to answer:
	•	Where people drop off
	•	Which CTAs get clicked
	•	Which plans are viewed/selected
	•	How many previews are generated
	•	How many previews turn into claims

Basic events are enough. No need to over-instrument.

⸻

7. Email Capture + One Follow-Up Exists

At minimum:
	•	Capture email early in onboarding
	•	One follow-up email if they don’t finish:
	•	“Your site preview is ready”
	•	Link back to resume

This alone can recover meaningful conversions.

⸻

⚠️ STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (High ROI, Low Risk)

These materially improve trust and learning but shouldn’t block launch if one slips.

⸻

8. Light Social Proof (Even Text-Only)

You don’t need logos yet.

Examples:
	•	“Built for local businesses like HVAC, plumbing, bakeries, and more”
	•	Short testimonial-style quote (even anonymized)
	•	“Early customers are using Arclo to stop worrying about their website”

This reduces the “am I the first?” fear.

⸻

9. Small FAQ Section (Huge Objection Killer)

4–6 questions max:
	•	Do I need to understand SEO?
	•	Do I need to update my site myself?
	•	What if I already have a website?
	•	Can I use my existing domain?
	•	How long until my site is live?
	•	Can I cancel anytime?

You’ve already solved these in product — surface them.

⸻

10. Resources Page Feels Finished

Confirm:
	•	Blog posts are complete
	•	Images are relevant
	•	Internal links exist
	•	No placeholder content
	•	Tone is consistent (non-technical, outcome-focused)

Your resources page already looks great — just ensure nothing feels “draft”.

⸻

⏭️ POST-LAUNCH (DO NOT BLOCK LAUNCH)

These are important, but only after real users.

⸻

11. Training / “DIY vs Arclo” Content

Good idea, but:
	•	Launch first
	•	Watch where users hesitate
	•	Then add training where friction actually exists

⸻

12. More Add-Ons or Pricing Experiments

Wait until you see:
	•	Which add-ons get attached
	•	Where users ask questions
	•	What objections actually come up

⸻

13. Long-Form Case Studies

You’ll get better ones after:
	•	5–10 real customers
	•	Before/after screenshots
	•	Real quotes

⸻

FINAL LAUNCH READINESS QUESTION

If a non-technical small business owner lands on Arclo for the first time, can they answer these in under 30 seconds?
	1.	What does this do for me?
	2.	Do I have to do any work?
	3.	What happens if I click this button?
	4.	Can I back out if I don’t like it?

If yes → ship.

⸻

MY STRONG RECOMMENDATION

You’re past the point where more thinking helps.

Your product:
	•	Has a clear value prop
	•	Solves a real pain
	•	Looks good
	•	Is differentiated
	•	Is priced confidently

Launch, watch 10 users touch it, then iterate.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a 1-page launch checklist you can literally tick off
	•	Walk through the site as a fake customer and point out last-mile friction
	•	Help you define Week 1 vs Week 4 success metrics

Just tell me.
