Short answer: yes, this mostly worked the way I expected — and it’s close to being very strong — but there are a few important refinements I’d make before calling it “done.”

I’ll break this into:
	1.	What worked exactly as intended
	2.	What’s not quite landing yet
	3.	Specific, low-risk improvements I’d recommend next

⸻

1. What worked (this is good)

A. The modular add-on layout works

This was the right direction.
	•	The cards feel selectable and composable
	•	Grouping by Content & Updates, Search Visibility, Growth & Leads makes sense
	•	It communicates “you’re building a growth system,” not buying random SEO things

This is much better than a long pricing table.

⸻

B. The value statements are directionally right

Even though they’re still slightly truncated in the screenshot, the intent is right:
	•	They explain why someone would add the thing
	•	They don’t force the user to understand SEO
	•	They connect to outcomes (show up more, improve over time, know what’s working)

That aligns with everything we discussed earlier.

⸻

C. “Most Popular” and “Growth Package” cues are good

This helps anchor decision-making.

People don’t want to design a marketing stack — they want reassurance they’re picking the “normal” option.

⸻

2. What’s not landing yet (and why)

This is subtle but important.

A. The page still feels a bit like “tools,” not “results”

Even with better copy, the mental model is still:

“I’m picking features”

Instead of:

“I’m buying more customers / faster growth”

That’s not because the idea is wrong — it’s because the visual hierarchy still emphasizes selection over outcome.

⸻

B. The prices don’t yet feel justified at a glance

Not because they’re too high — but because:
	•	The value statements are still relatively soft
	•	There’s no quick mental math like:
“Oh, this gets me X more visibility / coverage / chances to be found”

Right now, users have to think to connect add-on → outcome.

We want that to be almost automatic.

⸻

C. Rank Tracking is still weak conceptually

This one stands out.

Even with better wording, most SMBs don’t emotionally care about “tracking.”

They care about:
	•	calls
	•	leads
	•	customers

Rank tracking feels like a “nice to know,” not a “need to have,” and it weakens the overall story unless reframed carefully.

⸻

3. What I’d improve next (high-confidence recommendations)

These are small changes with big impact.

⸻

1) Add one-line “outcome labels” to each section

Above each group, add a short gray subheading that reframes the category:

Content & Updates

Helps your site stay active and attract new customers over time

Search Visibility

Helps customers find you in more searches and more places

Growth & Leads

Helps you understand what’s working and turn visits into calls

This shifts the page from “features” → “results” without adding clutter.

⸻

2) Strengthen each add-on’s value statement just a bit

Not longer — just more concrete.

Examples (tightened versions):

Weekly Website Improvements

Keeps your site active and improving, which helps Google trust it more and send you new customers.

Weekly Blog Content (4/month)

Adds fresh content every week so your business has more chances to show up when customers search.

Location Page Expansion

Expands your reach into nearby cities so customers outside your immediate area can find you.

Technical SEO

Fixes behind-the-scenes issues that stop customers from finding or trusting your site.

Google Visibility Monitoring

Shows where customers are finding you so you know what’s driving real business.

Rank Tracking

Lets you confirm your visibility is improving as Arclo continues to grow your site.

Notice:
	•	Still no jargon
	•	Still no promises
	•	Slightly more tangible

⸻

3) Reposition Rank Tracking as optional reassurance

I would visually and conceptually de-emphasize it:
	•	Smaller card
	•	“Optional” or “For those who want visibility into progress”
	•	Or even group it under a collapsible “Insights” section

You don’t want people thinking:

“Do I need this to succeed?”

Because the answer is: no, Arclo does the work anyway.

⸻

4) Add a subtle “recommended setup” nudge

One small text line near the bottom:

Most businesses choose Weekly Improvements + Blog Content + Location Pages for steady growth.

This helps people who feel overwhelmed by choice.

⸻

Final verdict

Did this work the way I expected?
	•	Structurally: yes
	•	Conceptually: yes
	•	Conversion-wise: almost, but needs a bit more outcome framing

You’re not off — you’re just one refinement away from this page clearly saying:

“Pick how aggressively you want Arclo to bring you customers.”

If you want, next I can:
	•	Rewrite the exact microcopy for each card
	•	Help you define a default recommended bundle
	•	Decide whether Rank Tracking should stay, move, or be hidden
	•	Do a final conversion pass on the pricing page as if I were a skeptical SMB owner

Just tell me which one you want to tackle next.
