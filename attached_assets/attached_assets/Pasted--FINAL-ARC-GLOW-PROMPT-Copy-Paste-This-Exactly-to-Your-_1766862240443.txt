🧠 FINAL ARC GLOW PROMPT

(Copy/Paste This Exactly to Your Development Agent)

⸻

ARC GLOW PROMPT

Project: Arclo Homepage + Free Scan Funnel
Design System: Tailwind CSS (reuse existing Arclo tokens, colors, typography, spacing)
Framework: Existing Arclo stack (do not introduce new frameworks)
Scope: Homepage + Scan Flow UX (no backend logic required beyond stubs)

⸻

GOAL

Rebuild the Arclo homepage and scan experience to support a friction-free SEO diagnostic funnel where:
	•	Users run a free SEO scan using only a website URL
	•	The scan runs immediately (no login, no email)
	•	Users see real preview insights
	•	Email is required to unlock the full report
	•	Account creation is optional until users want to save or act

Do not redesign the brand. Preserve the current Arclo look and feel.

HOMEPAGE REQUIREMENTS (/)

Hero Section
	•	Headline:
Get a complete SEO action plan from your website — no setup required.
	•	Subhead:
Enter your website URL and Arclo scans it for technical issues, keyword opportunities, and competitor gaps — then turns it into a clear, prioritized plan.
	•	Primary CTA:
	•	Input: Enter your website (e.g. example.com)
	•	Button: Run Free Site Scan
	•	Secondary CTA: See a sample report
	•	Microcopy under CTA:
No logins • No integrations • Takes ~60 seconds

⸻

FREE SCAN FLOW (/scan or equivalent)

Step 1: URL Submission
	•	Accept website URL only
	•	Immediately begin scan

Step 2: Progress Screen (45–60 seconds)
Show real, sequential steps:
	•	Crawling site structure
	•	Analyzing technical SEO
	•	Identifying keyword opportunities
	•	Finding competitors
	•	Generating action plan

Each step visually completes before moving on.

⸻

Step 3: Preview Report (UNGATED)

Show real but limited insights, such as:
	•	Number of technical issues found
	•	Number of keyword opportunities identified
	•	Number of competitors detected
	•	High-level summaries

Do not show:
	•	Full keyword lists
	•	Specific URLs
	•	Detailed fixes
	•	Prioritized steps

Use visual locking (blur / disabled states) for gated sections.

⸻

Step 4: Soft Gate (EMAIL ONLY)

Overlay or inline gate:

Title:
Unlock your full SEO report

Copy:
Enter your email to view the complete report, save it, and receive a copy.

Form:
	•	Email input
	•	Button: View full report

Small disclaimer:
We’ll email you a copy. No spam.

⸻

Step 5: Full Report (POST-EMAIL)

Once email is submitted:
	•	Unlock all sections
	•	Show full detail
	•	Display CTA:
Create an account to save this report and staff your AI crew

Account creation is optional at this stage.

⸻

CREW INTRO (HOMEPAGE SECTION)
	•	Light introduction only (no ship UI here)
	•	Headline:
Turn insights into action with AI specialists
	•	Show 4–6 agent tiles with:
	•	Role
	•	One-line outcome
	•	CTA:
Staff your AI crew

⸻

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
	•	Reuse existing Tailwind config
	•	No new color tokens
	•	Mobile-first
	•	Lighthouse-friendly
	•	Clean semantic HTML
	•	Analytics hooks on:
	•	Run Free Site Scan
	•	Email unlock
	•	Staff your AI crew

⸻

DO NOT
	•	Require GA4, Search Console, or integrations
	•	Require account creation before value
	•	Add game-like visuals
	•	Add heavy animations
	•	Change typography or spacing system

⸻

SUCCESS CRITERIA
	•	User understands value within 10 seconds
	•	Free scan requires only a URL
	•	Preview insights feel real
	•	Email gating feels natural, not forced
	•	Clear path from report → crew staffing

⸻

🧩 WHY YOU SHOULD SHIP THIS NOW

You’ve now:
	•	Solved the funnel
	•	Solved friction
	•	Solved trust
	•	Solved monetization sequencing

At this point, execution beats thinking.

Let the agent build v1. Once it’s live, we can:
	•	Tighten copy
	•	Improve preview vs gated balance
	•	Tune conversion rates
	•	Add crew recommendations post-report

When you’re ready, the very next thing I’d suggest is designing the post-report “Next Best Crew Member” recommendation logic — but only after you see this live.
