Perfect.
We’ll do Step 2 cleanly and explicitly, but still keep it internal-facing so it supports product + content without leaking SEO jargon into the UI.

⸻

STEP 2 — ARCLO KEYWORD MAP (INTERNAL)

Purpose of this step
Create a single, authoritative keyword map that:
	•	Powers blog content
	•	Powers add-ons (blogs, location pages, improvements)
	•	Ensures Arclo ranks for the right terms
	•	Keeps messaging aligned with “get more customers” (not SEO-speak)

This is not customer-facing.
This is the internal engine that everything else plugs into.

⸻

How to Use This Keyword Map
	•	Every blog post must cover:
	•	1 primary keyword
	•	3–4 supporting keywords
	•	Every pricing add-on maps to one or more clusters
	•	Over time, this becomes your content & authority moat
