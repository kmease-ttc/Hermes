Here’s a final design pass on the homepage plus a short “dev tasks” list you can hand off.

I’ll go top → bottom and call out only the things still worth tightening.

---

## Global polish

1. Visual rhythm between sections

   * Check that vertical spacing between all sections is consistent: roughly the same top/bottom padding for:

     * Hero
     * Features
     * How It Works
     * Real Results
     * Pricing
     * Examples
     * Roadmap
   * If anything feels a bit loose, it’s usually the gap **between** sections, not inside them—trim any extra 24–32px gaps where white shows without content.

2. Background transitions

   * You now have a light → dark → light → dark flow. Make sure gradients overlap smoothly:

     * Hero bottom → Features: both should sit on the same light bg (`from white via slate-50 to slate-100`).
     * Real Results (dark) → Pricing (light): add a faint white gradient overlay at the bottom of the dark section or top of pricing so there’s no harsh line.
     * Roadmap → Footer: looks good already, just keep the glow subtle so the footer reads clearly as its own dark band.

3. Typography scale

   * H1 (hero) > H2 (section headings) > card titles > body text.
   * Quick check: body copy should never visually compete with section headings—if anything feels close, drop body text down 1 Tailwind size (e.g. `text-base` instead of `text-lg`).

4. Interactions / accessibility

   * Ensure every button & link has:

     * a visible hover state **and** a visible focus ring (`focus-visible:outline` etc.).
   * Check that the glass cards and floating tags still look good in high-contrast mode and at 90%/110% zoom.

---

## Hero section

Looks strong overall. Nits:

1. Align hero card with header

   * Make sure the top of the hero card is visually aligned with the **inner** nav pill, not the top of the viewport. If the hero feels a couple pixels too low or high compared to the header, nudge it.

2. Floating tags positioning

   * Check that tags don’t get too close to the hero card edge on smaller laptops. You want at least ~16px breathing room from the card edge so they don’t feel cramped.

3. Mobile stack

   * On mobile: confirm order is

     1. text
     2. mockup
     3. tags, if they wrap
   * If any tags feel awkward on small screens, show only **2** tags on mobile and all 4 on tablet+.

---

## Features (“Everything Included”) section

Already looks very good. Just:

1. Highlight card consistency

   * The “Autonomous SEO Engine” highlight card has a gradient border. Make sure:

     * The inner padding matches the other cards
     * Its drop shadow is slightly stronger but not a different *color* (stick to the same shadow hue across all).

2. Icon chips

   * Ensure all icons are the same stroke weight and size (`w-5 h-5` or `w-6 h-6` consistently).
   * On hover, the chip scale animation should be small (`scale-105` max) to avoid feeling bouncy.

---

## How It Works section

This one is more complex visually, so:

1. Timeline line + nodes

   * Make sure the vertical line is faint (low opacity) and **behind** the cards, not competing with text.
   * Nodes (if any) should match your primary gradient (`indigo → purple → sky`) and use the same glow as stat cards.

2. Step spacing

   * Keep consistent spacing between steps (`space-y-10` or `space-y-12`).
   * Ensure step numbers and titles line up vertically so the eye can scan down easily.

3. Mobile behavior

   * On mobile, drop the vertical line completely and treat steps as standalone cards stacked with even spacing.

---

## Real Results (dark section)

This looks great now; just two final checks:

1. Analytics curve

   * Keep opacity very low so it reads as texture, not a chart the user tries to interpret.
2. Card widths

   * On smaller laptops, make sure the three stat cards don’t feel too wide. If they do, add a `max-w-sm` and center them, or let them wrap into 2 + 1 on medium screens.

---

## Pricing

Styling is much better; now:

1. “Popular” badge

   * Confirm the Pro card badge is visually consistent with other pills (same radius, font size, letter spacing).

2. Card shadows

   * Starter/Agency: standard shadow.
   * Pro: slightly stronger shadow and a subtle gradient bg.
   * Keep radii identical across all three cards.

3. Mobile

   * Stack as single-column cards with comfortable spacing (`space-y-6`). Pro card should still clearly feel “featured” (e.g. slightly different bg).

---

## Examples (“Sites Built by Arclo”)

Looks strong.

1. Overlay CTA

   * Make sure “View Live Site” chip is readable over different screenshots; if any are busy, darken the gradient overlay slightly on hover.

2. Category badges

   * Keep category names short & consistent case:

     * HEALTHCARE
     * HOSPITALITY
     * PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

---

## Roadmap + Footer

You already spotted the glow issue and it’s vastly improved. Final checks:

1. Roadmap pills

   * Now that icons are in, make sure all icon colors are desaturated enough not to look “emoji bright.” Slightly muted tones will keep it premium.
2. Footer columns

   * Align column headings (Product / Company / Legal) to the same baseline and ensure link line-height is the same as elsewhere.

## Concrete “Send to Dev” Checklist

You can literally paste this:

1. Verify consistent vertical spacing between all homepage sections; adjust top/bottom paddings so they feel even from hero → features → how-it-works → results → pricing → examples → roadmap → footer.
2. Ensure all buttons/links (including floating tags, feature cards, examples, pricing CTAs, roadmap pills) have:

   * hover state
   * keyboard focus-visible outline.
3. Double-check responsive behavior:

   * Hero stacks cleanly; floating tags don’t collide with card edges on mobile.
   * Features, stats, pricing, and examples degrade gracefully to 1-column on small screens.
   * Roadmap pills wrap nicely and stay centered on small widths.
4. Soften any remaining hard section edges by:

   * Adding subtle top/bottom white fades where a dark section meets a light section, if you see a visible line.
5. Compress/export hero/example screenshots and mockups as WebP (or optimized PNG) at 2× resolution and ensure they’re using the same corner radius across the site.

If they run through that list, the homepage will be in really good shape and visually cohesive end-to-end.
