Goal: improve ranking + crawl efficiency for arclo.pro without breaking the React SPA. Prioritize: (1) basic SEO hygiene, (2) schema, (3) crawlable pages, (4) server-rendered/static HTML for above-the-fold content.

1. Add user-declared canonical + basic meta hygiene (home + all pages)

* For every route/page, output:
  * <link rel="canonical" href="https://arclo.pro/<path>" />
  * <title>…</title> (unique per page)
  * <meta name="description" content="…" /> (unique per page)
  * OpenGraph + Twitter tags (unique per page where possible)
* Requirements:
  * Canonical must always be the HTTPS version on arclo.pro (no trailing slash inconsistencies; pick one convention and enforce it).
  * If we ever serve the same content via multiple URLs (e.g., with/without trailing slash, query params), canonical must point to the preferred version.

2. Add schema.org structured data (JSON-LD)

* Add Organization schema sitewide (in <head>):
  * name: "Arclo"
  * url: "https://arclo.pro/"
  * logo: "https://arclo.pro/<logo-path>"
  * sameAs: include any real socials (only if they exist)
* Add WebSite schema sitewide:
  * url, name, potentialAction SearchAction only if we actually have on-site search (otherwise omit)
* Add SoftwareApplication (or Product) schema on the homepage and /pricing:
  * name: Arclo
  * applicationCategory: "BusinessApplication"
  * operatingSystem: "Web"
  * offers: include pricing if it’s public (priceCurrency, price, url to pricing page)
  * aggregateRating only if real ratings exist (do not fake)
* Validate with Google Rich Results Test and schema validator; fix any warnings that are meaningful.

3. Ensure robots.txt + sitemap.xml are correct and discoverable

* robots.txt at https://arclo.pro/robots.txt must:
  * Allow crawling for the site (no accidental Disallow: /)
  * Include: Sitemap: https://arclo.pro/sitemap.xml
* sitemap.xml:
  * Must list canonical URLs for: /, /how-it-works, /pricing, /examples (and any other public pages)
  * Use <lastmod> where feasible (ISO date)
  * Ensure it returns 200 and correct content-type (application/xml or text/xml)
* Submit sitemap in Google Search Console (Sitemaps report) after deployment.

4. Create 3 crawlable, content-rich pages (minimum)
   Create these routes and make sure each has unique title/description, a real H1, and substantive HTML text (not only client-rendered placeholders):
   A) /how-it-works

* H1: “How Arclo works” (or similar)
* 3–6 step explanation with headings (H2s)
* Clear value proposition + outcomes
  B) /pricing
* H1: “Pricing”
* Plan cards and feature bullets (rendered in HTML)
* FAQ section (optional, but good)
  C) /examples (or /industries)
* H1: “Examples” or “Industries we support”
* 6–12 short sections (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, legal, etc.)
* Each section: what we generate + what improves over time

5. Add server-rendered OR static HTML “above-the-fold” fallback (high impact)
   Right now the HTML is basically a JS shell. We need Google (and users) to see meaningful content immediately.
   Pick ONE approach (prefer the simplest for our stack):

Option A (Preferred): Move to SSR/SSG

* Migrate marketing pages to Next.js (or equivalent) with SSR/SSG:
  * Homepage, /how-it-works, /pricing, /examples should be statically generated (SSG) or SSR.
  * Keep the React app/hydration for interactivity; content must exist in the initial HTML response.
* Acceptance criteria:
  * “View Source” shows real text content, headings, links (not just <div id="root">).
  * Lighthouse/PSI shows improved SEO and faster contentful paint.

Option B (Fastest): Pre-render marketing routes

* If we can’t migrate yet, implement prerendering for bots:
  * Use a prerender service (Prerender.io or Rendertron-style) OR server middleware that serves prerendered HTML to known crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.).
  * Ensure canonical URLs are consistent and no cloaking (serve equivalent content to users—just rendered).
* Acceptance criteria:
  * Googlebot receives HTML with the hero headline, subheadline, feature bullets, and internal links present.

Option C (Minimum viable): Static HTML injection for critical content

* If SSR/prerender is too much right now:
  * Server should return an initial HTML document that contains:
    * H1 hero headline (keyword-aligned)
    * 1–2 sentence value prop
    * Feature list (3–6 bullets)
    * Primary CTAs as real <a> links (not only JS-bound buttons)
    * Basic internal links to /how-it-works, /pricing, /examples
  * Then React hydrates/enhances after load.
* Acceptance criteria:
  * “View Source” includes those elements and links.

6. Add internal linking + nav consistency

* Ensure main nav includes links to:
  * How it works
  * Pricing
  * Examples
* Add footer with:
  * Links to all key pages
  * Contact / support email
  * Privacy / Terms (even if simple)
* Make sure all links are real <a href="..."> (crawlable), not only onClick handlers.

7. Add basic technical SEO checks

* Ensure:
  * Only one H1 per page.
  * H2/H3 used for structure.
  * Images have alt text (especially hero/feature images).
  * 404 page exists and returns proper status.
  * Redirect http → https, and enforce either trailing slash or no trailing slash consistently.

8. Post-deploy verification checklist (must do)

* In Google Search Console:
  * URL Inspection: test live URL for /, /how-it-works, /pricing, /examples → confirm “Page fetch successful”
  * Submit sitemap and confirm no errors
* In-browser:
  * “View Source” on each page shows meaningful text + canonical + schema
* Optional:
  * Run Lighthouse and ensure SEO category isn’t failing due to missing metadata / no index issues.

Deliverables from dev

* PR #1: Canonicals + titles/descriptions + schema JSON-LD + robots/sitemap
* PR #2: Build the 3 pages with real HTML content + internal links
* PR #3: SSR/SSG or prerendering implementation (or minimum static fallback), plus verification screenshots from “View Source” and GSC live test
