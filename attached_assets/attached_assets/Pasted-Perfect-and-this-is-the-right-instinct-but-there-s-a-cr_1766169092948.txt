Perfect — and this is the **right instinct**, but there’s a critical correction you need to make first:

You **do not** want random traffic yet.
You want **diagnostic traffic**.

Right now your GA screenshot actually confirms this:

* ~29 users
* Mostly Direct / Unassigned
* Very low clicks
* Almost no meaningful events

That means you don’t know **why** people aren’t engaging — because the traffic isn’t targeted or intentional.

So here’s how to get traffic **specifically to learn**, not to “grow”.

---

## Phase 1: Traffic whose job is to expose friction (not convert)

Your goal for the next 7–10 days is **behavioral signal**, not signups.

You want to answer:

* Where do they stop scrolling?
* What wording confuses them?
* Do they trust it?
* What do they *try* to do that you didn’t expect?

### Success metric right now

* Scroll depth
* Time to first interaction
* Form start (even if abandoned)
* Rage clicks / dead clicks (via Clarity)

Not conversions.

## Phase 2: The 3 fastest traffic sources that actually work for this product

### 1. Google Ads — but only ONE micro-intent campaign

This is the fastest, cleanest signal you can get.

Do **not** do broad SEO ads.

Run **one** campaign with keywords like:

* “SEO for small business”
* “I don’t know SEO”
* “SEO without agency”
* “done for you SEO”
* “SEO service but cheaper”

Exact or phrase match only.

Landing page rule:

* One headline
* One action
* No scrolling maze

Budget:

* $10–$20/day
* 3–5 days is enough to learn

What you’re watching:

* Do they scroll past the hero?
* Do they hesitate at trust points?
* Do they click pricing before anything else?

If nobody even *starts* the flow → messaging is wrong, not traffic.

### 2. Reddit (manual, not ads) — extremely high signal

This is gold for **SEO-for-non-SEO-people**.

Find posts in:

* r/smallbusiness
* r/Entrepreneur
* r/SEO (careful here)
* r/startups (only if framed right)

Look for posts like:

* “SEO is confusing”
* “Agency screwed me”
* “Is SEO worth it?”

Your response is **not** a pitch.

It’s:

> “I got sick of dealing with this, so I built something that just handles it automatically. Curious if this is stupid or useful.”

Link once.
Be honest.
Invite criticism.

These users will:

* scroll everything
* try to break it
* tell you exactly what feels fake

That’s priceless.

---

### 3. Cold traffic from people who already pay for SEO

This sounds counterintuitive, but it works.

Target:

* Local service businesses
* Sites with obvious SEO blogs
* Wix / Squarespace sites ranking poorly

Message (email or DM):

> “Quick question — if SEO ran itself and you never had to touch it, would that even be interesting to you, or is that a red flag?”

No link in the first message.
Link only if they say “interesting”.

These users are high-intent and brutally honest.

---

## Phase 3: Fix GA so it actually tells you something

Right now your GA events are basically useless.

You need **these events**, minimum:

* Hero CTA click
* First scroll past hero
* Form start
* Field focus (first input)
* Form abandon (no submit after X seconds)

Without this, traffic is wasted.

Also:

* Connect Search Console immediately (GA literally told you to)
* Add Clarity if it’s not already installed
* Watch recordings, not charts

You should be watching **actual sessions**, not dashboards.

---

## Phase 4: What NOT to do (this will save you time)

Do NOT:

* “Wait for SEO to kick in”
* Post generic LinkedIn updates
* Run Meta ads
* Write blog content yet
* Chase signups

All of that comes **after** you see people try to use it.

---

## The hard truth (important)

If you put **100 highly relevant users** on this site and:

* They don’t scroll
* They don’t start the flow
* They don’t ask “when will this work?”

Then the problem is not traffic.
It’s **belief**.

And belief is solved with:

* Narrower promise
* Proof
* Specificity
* Less “AI magic” language

---

## What I’d do next if I were you (very concrete)

Today:

1. Connect Search Console
2. Add Clarity
3. Simplify homepage to ONE CTA

Tomorrow:
4. Launch $15/day Google Ads
5. Manually post on Reddit
6. DM 5 real businesses

By day 5:

* Watch 30–50 sessions
* Write down every hesitation
* Rewrite copy based on *what they do*, not what they say

---

If you want, next I can:

* Tell you **exactly** which Google Ads keywords to run first
* Rewrite your hero so people scroll
* Define the first interactive flow step-by-step
* Look at your Clarity recordings with you and interpret them

Say which one you want to tackle first.
