DEV INSTRUCTIONS — NEXT VISIBILITY TASKS FOR ARCLO.PRO (DO THESE IN ORDER)

Goal
Increase organic visibility by (1) making Google clearly understand what Arclo is, and (2) increasing the number of indexable pages that can rank, without bloating the site.

Priority 1 — Clarify “What is Arclo?” on the homepage (highest ROI)
	1.	Add a single, explicit H1 above the fold

	•	Requirement: exactly one H1 on the page.
	•	Must be plain HTML text (not an image, not canvas, not SVG text).
	•	Example (use this unless we already have something equivalent):
H1: “Automated Websites, SEO, and Monitoring for Small Businesses”

	2.	Add a short “value prop” block directly under the H1 (plain text)

	•	3–5 bullets, each 8–14 words.
	•	Must be visible on initial load (no accordion required).
	•	Example bullets:
	•	“Generate a complete website in minutes, then improve it weekly.”
	•	“Automated technical SEO fixes and on-page optimizations.”
	•	“Uptime + error monitoring included so you know what’s breaking.”
	•	“Simple pricing with clear deliverables—no agency retainers.”

	3.	Add a one-paragraph “What you get” section below the fold

	•	80–140 words.
	•	Include keywords naturally: “website”, “SEO”, “monitoring”, “small business”.
	•	Avoid jargon (“AI-powered” is fine once, but not repeated).

Acceptance check
	•	View page source: H1 and bullet text must appear in the HTML.
	•	Lighthouse/Pagespeed: no layout shift from this block.

Priority 2 — Create 5 indexable “Feature” landing pages (multiplies ranking surface)
Create route group: /features/{slug}
	4.	Add these 5 pages (exact slugs)

	•	/features/automated-website
	•	/features/seo-automation
	•	/features/monitoring-and-alerts
	•	/features/local-seo
	•	/features/weekly-improvements

	5.	Feature page template requirements
Each page must include:

	•	Unique  tag (55–60 chars) containing the main phrase
	•	Unique meta description (140–160 chars)
	•	One H1 (plain text) matching page intent
	•	400–650 words of unique body content (plain HTML)
	•	A “How it works” numbered list (3–6 steps)
	•	A small FAQ section (3–5 Q&As) with real text (not collapsed by default)
	•	2–4 internal links:
	•	link to homepage
	•	link to /pricing (or checkout page)
	•	link to /features (index page)
	•	link to 1–2 other feature pages

	6.	Add a /features index page

	•	URL: /features
	•	Contains a grid/list linking to each feature page with:
	•	feature name
	•	1-sentence summary
	•	Must be crawlable and linked from the main nav and footer.

Acceptance check
	•	All 6 pages render server-side (no blank initial HTML).
	•	View source contains the page content (not just a JS bundle).
	•	Internal links work and are not nofollow.

Priority 3 — Add basic structured data (Software + Organization)
7) Add JSON-LD schema on the homepage
Implement a single JSON-LD script tag in  (or near end of body) with:
	•	Organization
	•	WebSite
	•	SoftwareApplication (or Product)
Keep it simple and valid.

Minimum fields to include
Organization:
	•	name
	•	url
	•	logo (absolute URL)
	•	sameAs (optional; include if we have socials)

WebSite:
	•	name
	•	url

SoftwareApplication:
	•	name (“Arclo”)
	•	applicationCategory (“BusinessApplication”)
	•	operatingSystem (“Web”)
	•	offers (optional; include price if stable)

Acceptance check
	•	Validate with Google Rich Results Test (should show no errors).
	•	Ensure logo URL is correct and publicly accessible.

Priority 4 — Add a sitemap and robots hygiene (make crawling effortless)
8) Ensure sitemap.xml exists and is linked in robots.txt
	•	/sitemap.xml should include:
	•	homepage
	•	/pricing
	•	/features
	•	all /features/* pages
	•	any core flow pages that should be indexed (exclude dashboard/auth pages)

	9.	Robots rules

	•	Disallow private/app routes:
	•	/app
	•	/dashboard
	•	/admin
	•	any auth callback paths
	•	Allow everything else.

Acceptance check
	•	Open /robots.txt in browser
	•	Open /sitemap.xml in browser
	•	Submit sitemap in Google Search Console

Priority 5 — Add “Location” pages only if Arclo is going after local intent
If we are targeting “local SEO” and small businesses in cities, add a few location pages now.
	10.	Optional route group: /locations/{slug}
Start with 5 only:

	•	/locations/austin-tx
	•	/locations/san-antonio-tx
	•	/locations/houston-tx
	•	/locations/dallas-tx
	•	/locations/orlando-fl

Template requirements (same as features):
	•	Unique title/meta
	•	Unique H1
	•	400–650 words unique
	•	internal links to /features/local-seo and /pricing

Important
Do NOT mass-generate hundreds yet. We only do that after we confirm conversion and content quality.

What NOT to do in this sprint
	•	Do not create backlink selling pages yet.
	•	Do not launch paid ads until the above is live and indexed.
	•	Do not publish thin pages (<250 words) or duplicated templates.

Definition of done for this “Visibility Sprint”
	•	Homepage has explicit H1 + bullets + “What you get” paragraph
	•	/features index exists and is linked from nav/footer
	•	5 feature pages exist with unique content and internal links
	•	Schema added and validates
	•	sitemap.xml + robots.txt correct and submitted
	•	Search Console shows pages discovered and indexing begins (no major errors)
