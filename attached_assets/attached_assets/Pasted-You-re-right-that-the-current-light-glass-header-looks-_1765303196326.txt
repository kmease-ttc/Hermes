You’re right that the current light glass header looks a bit odd sitting on top of the full-dark pricing hero. But I wouldn’t create *two totally different headers* – that usually makes the product feel like two different sites.

Better approach: **one header component with a `variant` (on-light / on-dark)** that only changes colors, not layout.

Here’s what I’d do and what to tell your dev.

---

## Design call

* Keep the **same structure** everywhere:

  * thin tagline bar on very top
  * pill-shaped nav bar with logo + links + CTA
* Add a **`variant="dark"`** style for pages whose hero is dark (like Pricing, maybe Real Results later).
* On dark pages, the nav pill should feel more integrated with the dark background:

  * darker, translucent background
  * white text
  * gradient CTA that pops

That keeps consistency while making the pricing page feel intentional.

## Dev instructions

### 1. Update the Header component to accept a variant

```tsx
type HeaderProps = {
  variant?: "light" | "dark";
};

export function Header({ variant = "light" }: HeaderProps) {
  const isDark = variant === "dark";

  return (
    <header className="sticky top-0 z-40">
      {/* top tagline bar stays the same */}
      <div className="w-full bg-slate-900 text-[10px] tracking-[0.2em] text-slate-300 py-1 text-center uppercase">
        Built for people who don’t want to think about SEO
      </div>

      <div className="flex justify-center px-4 pt-4">
        <nav
          className={`
            flex items-center justify-between gap-6
            w-full max-w-5xl
            rounded-full border backdrop-blur-xl px-5 py-2
            ${isDark
              ? "bg-slate-900/80 border-slate-700 shadow-[0_10px_35px_rgba(15,23,42,0.75)] text-slate-100"
              : "bg-white/80 border-slate-200 shadow-[0_10px_30px_rgba(15,23,42,0.12)] text-slate-800"}
          `}
        >
          {/* logo + nav links + CTA */}
        </nav>
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}
```

### 2. Use `variant="dark"` on the Pricing page

In `PricingPage` (or the route component):

```tsx
export default function PricingPage() {
  return (
    <AppLayout headerVariant="dark">
      {/* pricing content */}
    </AppLayout>
  );
}
```

And in `AppLayout` pass the prop down:

```tsx
export function AppLayout({
  children,
  headerVariant = "light",
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  headerVariant?: "light" | "dark";
}) {
  return (
    <>
      <Header variant={headerVariant} />
      <main>{children}</main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

### 3. Keep all other pages on the light variant

* Home, What We Do, Examples, About, Contact, FAQ → `headerVariant="light"` (or default).
* Pricing (and any future dark-hero page) → `headerVariant="dark"`.

---

## Small visual tweaks for the dark header

On the dark variant:

* Nav links: `text-slate-100` default, `hover:text-white`.
* Active route pill: `bg-slate-800/80` instead of light grey.
* CTA button:

  ```tsx
  className="rounded-full bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-400 via-purple-500 to-sky-400 text-white px-5 py-2 text-sm font-medium shadow-[0_8px_30px_rgba(59,130,246,0.6)]"
  ```

That will make the header sit naturally on the dark pricing hero without feeling like a light sticker pasted on top.

If you’d like, next step we can quickly sanity-check each page with the new header variants once your dev wires this up.
