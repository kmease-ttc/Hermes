PROMPT: Finish and Optimize the Arclo Blog / Resources Page for SEO & Conversion

You are completing the Arclo blog/resources page at /blog.

Your goals are:
	1.	Publish high-quality blog posts that help Arclo rank in Google.
	2.	Apply blog SEO best practices automatically (without exposing jargon to readers).
	3.	Add relevant images to each blog.
	4.	Ensure blogs are internally linked and support Arclo’s core keyword strategy.
	5.	Make the blog useful for small business owners, not SEO experts.

1. Blog Content Requirements

Audience
	•	Local business owners (HVAC, plumbing, bakery, med spa, etc.)
	•	Non-technical
	•	They care about:
	•	more customers
	•	showing up on Google
	•	having their website “handled”

Tone
	•	Clear
	•	Helpful
	•	Practical
	•	No SEO jargon unless explained simply
	•	Never assume the reader knows marketing terms

2. Keyword Strategy (Internal Only – Do NOT Expose Jargon to Readers)

Internally, Arclo needs to rank for keywords related to:
	•	AI website builder
	•	Done-for-you websites
	•	Local business SEO
	•	Getting found on Google
	•	Service + city pages
	•	Small business websites
	•	Website optimization
	•	AI marketing for local businesses

Agent Instructions
	1.	Generate or reuse Arclo’s top ~100 target keywords, grouped into clusters.
	2.	For each blog post:
	•	Select 1 primary keyword
	•	Select 3–4 supporting keywords from the same cluster
	3.	Each blog post must clearly cover at least 4 relevant keywords from Arclo’s overall strategy.
	4.	Keywords must be woven naturally into the content — do not keyword-stuff.

3. Blog Structure (Must Follow This Exactly)

Each blog post must include:
	1.	SEO Title (H1)
	•	Clear benefit
	•	Plain language
	•	Includes the primary keyword naturally

	•	Preview how the post helps
	3.	Body Sections
	•	Use H2 and H3 headings
	•	Break content into scannable sections

	4.	Internal Links
	•	Link to:
	•	At least 2 other Arclo blog posts
	•	At least 1 Arclo product or pricing page
	•	Anchor text must be natural (not “click here”).

	•	Meta description (≤ 155 characters)

4. Images for Each Blog Post

Image Requirements
	•	Each blog post must have:
	1.	Featured image (hero image) at the top
	2.	Optional 1–2 supporting images inside the post

Image Generation Rules
	•	Images must:
	•	Match the topic of the blog
	•	Look professional and modern
	•	Be relevant to local businesses
	•	Avoid:
	•	Generic office photos
	•	Random stock imagery
	•	Abstract tech visuals that don’t relate to small businesses

Image Prompt Guidelines

For each blog, generate images using prompts like:

“Create a clean, professional blog header image illustrating {blog topic} for small business owners.
Style: modern, friendly, real-world business setting.
Avoid generic corporate offices.
No text in the image.”

Image SEO
	•	Add descriptive alt text for every image
	•	Alt text should describe the image and relate to the blog topic

⸻

5. Cross-Linking Rules (Critical for Ranking)

Across the entire blog section:
	1.	Every blog post must:
	•	Link out to at least 2 other blog posts
	•	Receive links from at least 2 other blog posts
	2.	Create a hub-and-spoke structure:
	•	Core posts (e.g., “How to Get Found on Google as a Local Business”)
	•	Supporting posts that link back to the core post
	3.	Ensure no blog post is orphaned.

⸻

6. Blog Topics to Cover Immediately

Ensure the current and newly written blogs cover topics like:
	•	How small businesses get found on Google
	•	Why service and location pages matter
	•	Why outdated websites stop customers from calling
	•	How AI can manage a website automatically
	•	Common website mistakes local businesses make
	•	How Arclo replaces agencies and DIY website tools

If any of these themes are missing, create new posts to cover them.

⸻

7. Publishing & Quality Checks

Before marking the blog page “done”:
	•	Confirm every blog has:
	•	H1, H2s, internal links, images, tags
	•	Confirm each blog targets at least 4 Arclo keywords
	•	Confirm no blog uses unexplained SEO jargon
	•	Confirm images match the topic
	•	Confirm cross-linking is complete

⸻

8. Final Output

When complete:
	•	The /blog page should feel like a real resource center, not placeholder content
	•	A small business owner should feel helped
	•	Google should clearly understand:
	•	What Arclo does
	•	Who it’s for
	•	Why it’s authoritative in this space
