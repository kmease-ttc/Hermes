## **Section 2 — “Why Arclo Exists”**

Explain the *motivation*:

```
After building products at scale for MRI Software, MicroStrategy, Rimini Street, Jobvite, Amazon, and multiple startups, Kevin noticed the same problem across every business he encountered:

Small businesses are forced to pay thousands for websites, SEO agencies, and technical services — and still end up with outdated, under-optimized sites.

Arclo was created to fix that. One platform that builds your website, writes your content, fixes your SEO, and improves every day — automatically.
```

Great software should remove effort, not add to it.

```

* Add a **founder portrait** with rounded corners and a soft shadow.
* Include **iconography** to break up text (teams, revenue, AI, automation).
