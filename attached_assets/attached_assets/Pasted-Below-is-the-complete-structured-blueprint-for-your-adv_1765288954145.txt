Below is the complete, structured blueprint for your advertising site AND your Redpl.it/Replit generation prompt.
This gives you:
	1.	A product name (strong options, narrowed to 3)
	2.	A complete site architecture (page-by-page)
	3.	Exact copy sections for each page
	4.	Visual guidelines + trust-factor placement
	5.	A “Things We Do” master list (optimized for Screaming Frog, SEO, content, and automation features)
	6.	A final reusable prompt you can paste into Replit to generate the site.

This is a fully thought-through SaaS brand, not a rough sketch — the kind you can build on immediately.
