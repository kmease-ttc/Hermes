Add an explicit “Sign up” CTA that creates an account without forcing the “Generate My Free Site / ROI estimate” flow.

Implementation (Replit prompt)

Goal
Users should be able to:

1. Click “Generate My Free Site” (existing primary path) and go into the site/ROI flow exactly as-is.
2. Click “Sign up” (new path) and create an account with no site creation required.

UX changes

1. Header nav

* Add a “Sign up” link/button in the top nav (next to “Sign in”).
* Behavior:

  * If logged out: route to account-only signup.
  * If logged in: route to dashboard (or no-op / hide).

2. Hero / above-the-fold

* Keep “Generate My Free Site” as the primary CTA.
* Add a secondary CTA text link/button: “Just sign up” (or “Create account”) that routes to account-only signup.
* Optional microcopy under buttons: “No credit card required.”

Routing
You already added an account-only path as part of /get-started (“Just Create Account”). Reuse it so we don’t fork logic.

Option A (preferred): Direct route to account-only signup

* Header “Sign up” → /signup?mode=account (or /get-started?path=account then auto-forward)
* Hero “Just sign up” → same route.

Option B: Route to /get-started

* Header “Sign up” → /get-started with the “Just Create Account” option preselected or highlighted
* Slightly more clicks, but consistent with your existing selector page.

Frontend implementation details

1. Add nav item

* Update your header component to include:

  * “Sign up” (visible when logged out)
  * “Sign in” (existing)
* Styling: if you already have a primary gradient button for “Generate My Free Site”, make “Sign up” a simple button (outline) or plain link so it doesn’t compete.

2. Add hero secondary CTA

* Under the primary CTA, add “Just sign up” as a secondary action.
* It should route to the account-only signup route (same as header).

3. Ensure account-only signup doesn’t create a site

* Confirm the signup flow for the account-only mode:

  * Creates user + session
  * Sets onboarding_path = “account_only” (or similar)
  * Does not create a site
  * Redirects to dashboard empty state (which already prompts “Ready to build your website?”)

4. Analytics tracking (quick win)
   Track clicks separately so you can measure intent:

* event: cta_generate_free_site_clicked
* event: cta_signup_only_clicked (include source: “header” vs “hero”)

Copy suggestions

* Header: “Sign up”
* Hero secondary: “Just sign up”
* Signup page title: “Create your account”
* Description: “You can build your website whenever you’re ready.”

Acceptance criteria

* “Generate My Free Site” works exactly like today.
* “Sign up” (header + hero) creates an account without requiring site/ROI flow.
* After signup-only, user lands in dashboard empty state with the two buttons (“Create Your Website” and “Browse Examples”).
