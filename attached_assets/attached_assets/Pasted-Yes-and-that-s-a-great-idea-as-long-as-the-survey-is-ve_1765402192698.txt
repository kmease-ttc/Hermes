Yes, and that’s a great idea—as long as the survey is **very light** and never feels like a guilt trip.

Here’s exactly what to tell your developer to implement:

---

## 1. Add “No thanks” → survey entry point

On the preview page, under the Claim button:

```tsx
<div className="mt-4 text-center">
  <button
    type="button"
    className="text-sm text-slate-500 hover:text-slate-700 underline-offset-2 hover:underline"
    onClick={() => router.push(`/feedback?siteId=${siteId}`)}
  >
    No thanks — tell us why
  </button>
</div>
```

* `siteId` is the generated site’s id.
* If you don’t want a new page, this could open a modal instead; same questions.

---

## 2. New route: `/feedback` (or `/sites/[id]/feedback`)

Create a simple page or modal-style route:

* URL example: `/feedback?siteId=13`
* Layout: single column card, centered.

### Copy:

Title:
**Thanks for checking out your preview.
Two quick questions before you go?**

Subtitle:
“This helps us improve Arclo for businesses like yours.”

---

## 3. Survey questions (keep it fast)

Use 2–3 questions max.

### Q1 – Overall reaction (required)

“Why didn’t you want to claim this website?”

Type: radio buttons (one required):

* It didn’t look professional enough
* The copy/content wasn’t right
* The images / design weren’t right
* It didn’t match my brand
* I’m just exploring for now
* Other

If they choose “Other” → show a short text input.

### Q2 – What was most off? (optional)

“Which part needs the most improvement?”

Type: checkbox (multi-select):

* Hero section / above the fold
* Colors and overall style
* Images / photos
* Services or wording
* Layout / structure
* I don’t know how to judge it

### Q3 – Free text (optional)

“Anything specific we should know?”
Type: textarea (2–3 lines).

At the bottom:

* Primary button: **Submit feedback**
* Secondary text link: **Skip →** (goes straight to `/` or `/start`)

---

## 4. What happens after submit

On submit:

1. Save the feedback with:

   * `siteId`
   * `userId` (if logged in) or email if available
   * Q1 reason
   * Q2 selections
   * Q3 text
   * timestamp

2. Redirect to thank-you page or back to homepage:

Simple thank-you state:

> “Thanks for telling us. We’ll use this to improve Arclo.
> You can always try generating a new site later.”

Button: **Back to homepage**

---

## 5. Data model for feedback (DB)

New table: `SiteFeedback`

Fields:

* `id` (PK)
* `siteId` (FK to generated site)
* `userId` (nullable FK to users)
* `primaryReason` (string)
* `secondaryReasons` (json / text array)
* `details` (text)
* `createdAt` (timestamp)

You’ll use this later to see patterns:

* “Most common reason people say no”
* “How many previews are rejected because of design vs copy”
* Etc.

---

## 6. Non-blocking UX

Important:

* The **survey is optional**.
* “Skip” MUST be visible on the feedback page / modal.
* The preview page itself should still have both:

  * `Claim Your Website` (primary)
  * `No thanks — tell us why` (secondary)

If the user clicks “No thanks” and then “Skip,” they should still feel like they exited cleanly.

If you paste this into a dev ticket as “Preview decline flow + feedback survey,” they’ll know exactly what to build. After they wire it up, show me screenshots and I can tighten the copy and options.
