Perfect.
Step 4 is where everything clicks together — this is the part that turns your blog from “content” into a ranking + conversion system.

Below is a clean, agent-ready instruction set for Step 4.
No code. No jargon. This is the operating system for your content.

STEP 4 — ARCLO BLOG HUB, INTERNAL LINKING & PUBLISHING SYSTEM

Purpose

Turn the Arclo blog into a self-reinforcing growth engine that:
	•	Builds authority in Google
	•	Supports the pricing add-ons
	•	Reinforces the “Arclo gets you customers” message
	•	Grows stronger with every new post
	•	Requires minimal ongoing decision-making

⸻

1. Hub-and-Spoke Architecture (Required)

Core Rule

Not all blog posts are equal.

You must define:
	•	Pillar (Hub) posts → broad, high-level topics
	•	Supporting (Spoke) posts → specific problems or explanations

Every spoke must link up to a hub.
Every hub must link down to its spokes.

No orphan posts.

⸻

2. Define the Initial Blog Hubs

Create 4 core hub posts.
These are the backbone of the blog.

Hub 1 — Google Visibility

Topic: How local businesses get found on Google
Keyword cluster: Google visibility / local business discovery

This hub should:
	•	Explain how customers find businesses online
	•	Reference services, locations, content, and updates
	•	Softly position Arclo as the “done-for-you” solution

Hub 2 — Service Pages

Topic: Why service pages bring more customers
Keyword cluster: service pages / service-based websites

This hub should:
	•	Explain what service pages are
	•	Why they matter
	•	Common mistakes
	•	How Arclo handles them automatically

Hub 3 — Location Pages

Topic: Why location pages help you reach more customers
Keyword cluster: service areas / cities

This hub should:
	•	Explain city/service-area pages
	•	How customers search locally
	•	Why manual creation is hard
	•	How Arclo scales this automatically

Hub 4 — Website Conversions

Topic: Why most small business websites don’t get calls
Keyword cluster: website leads / calls

This hub should:
	•	Explain conversion basics in plain language
	•	Buttons, phone numbers, trust
	•	Why traffic without calls is useless
	•	How Arclo fixes this continuously

These 4 hubs should be longer, more comprehensive, and treated as cornerstone content.

⸻

3. Supporting (Spoke) Post Rules

Every new blog post after the hubs must:
	1.	Clearly belong to one primary hub
	2.	Link to that hub at least once
	3.	Link to 1–2 other related posts
	4.	Never exist in isolation

Example

Blog: “Why Location Pages Matter for HVAC Businesses”
	•	Primary hub: Location Pages
	•	Internal links:
	•	Link to “Why Location Pages Help You Reach More Customers” (hub)
	•	Link to “Why Service Pages Matter” (adjacent hub)
	•	Optional link to pricing or add-on

⸻

4. Internal Linking Rules (Critical)

Per Blog Post

Every post must include:
	•	2–3 internal links to other blog posts
	•	1 internal link to a product or pricing page

Anchor Text Rules
	•	Use natural language
	•	No “click here”
	•	Example:
	•	“how local businesses get found on Google”
	•	“service pages that bring in customers”

Distribution Rule
	•	Hubs link to spokes
	•	Spokes link back to hubs
	•	Over time, hubs accumulate the most links

⸻

5. Publishing Cadence (Realistic & Sustainable)

Recommended cadence
	•	1 blog post per week
	•	That aligns with:
	•	Blog Writing add-on (4 posts/month)
	•	Industry best practice
	•	Your pricing/value narrative

Monthly structure
	•	Week 1: Hub or hub-refresh post
	•	Weeks 2–4: Supporting posts tied to one hub

Rotate hubs monthly so all 4 get attention over time.

⸻

6. Ongoing Content Rules (So It Doesn’t Drift)

For every new post, the agent must answer “yes” to all of these:
	1.	Does this clearly help a small business owner understand how to get more customers?
	2.	Does this support one of the 4 hubs?
	3.	Does it avoid SEO jargon?
	4.	Does it reinforce that Arclo does this automatically?
	5.	Does it link to other content appropriately?

If not → rewrite or don’t publish.

⸻

7. Light Refresh Strategy (Important but Simple)

Every 90 days:
	•	Pick 1 hub post
	•	Update it by:
	•	Adding links to newer supporting posts
	•	Expanding 1–2 sections
	•	Improving clarity

This keeps hubs evergreen and authoritative.

⸻

8. How This Connects Back to Pricing & Add-Ons

This system supports your pricing page naturally:
	•	Blog Writing add-on = weekly content that feeds hubs
	•	Location Page Expansion = Location Pages hub
	•	Weekly Improvements = Hub refreshes + linking
	•	Technical SEO = “hidden issues” explained in hubs
	•	Visibility Monitoring = posts explaining how customers find businesses

No extra explanation needed — the content proves the value.

⸻

9. Agent Checklist (Copy/Paste Summary)

For the Arclo blog:
	•	Maintain 4 core hub posts.
	•	Every new blog post must link to a hub.
	•	Every post includes 2–3 internal links.
	•	Publish 1 post per week.
	•	Rotate hubs monthly.
	•	Refresh one hub every 90 days.
	•	Write only for non-technical small business owners.
	•	Always tie content back to “more customers, less work.”

⸻
