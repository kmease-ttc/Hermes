Perfect choice. This is the right sequencing — intake + internal workflow is what turns the “unlimited updates” promise into something operationally sane.

Below is the next agent prompt, written so it can be handed directly to your Replit agent or dev with no extra explanation.

⸻

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Update Request Intake & Internal Workflow

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement a simple, controlled request intake and execution workflow that allows customers to request website changes and allows Arclo (internal users) to process, track, and complete those requests efficiently.

This system must:
	•	support the “unlimited updates” promise
	•	prevent abuse or overload
	•	clearly show status to customers
	•	give internal operators a clean, focused work queue

Do NOT build a full ticketing system.

⸻

PART 1 — Customer Request Intake (Required)

Entry Point

Add a primary button in the site dashboard:

“Request a change”

Visible when:
	•	Site is published
	•	User has Managed Updates or Unlimited Updates

⸻

Request Form (Minimal)

Fields:
	•	Free-text input (required):
“What would you like to change?”
	•	Optional dropdown:
	•	Page / Section (Homepage, Services, About, Other)
	•	Optional URL reference field
	•	Optional file upload (images/logos only)

Rules:
	•	No rich text editor
	•	No previews
	•	Keep friction low

⸻

Submission Rules
	•	Unlimited Updates plan:
	•	Allow one active request at a time
	•	If one exists, disable button with message:
“You have a request in progress. You can submit another once it’s complete.”
	•	Base plan:
	•	Allow submission
	•	Display note:
“Requests are handled on a best-effort basis.”

⸻

After Submit
	•	Create a change_request record
	•	Status = queued
	•	Create an activity:
“Change request received”

Redirect user to request status view.

⸻

PART 2 — Request Status (Customer View)

Request Status Page

For each request, show:
	•	Submitted date
	•	Current status:
	•	queued
	•	in progress
	•	completed
	•	Short status message:
	•	“We’re reviewing your request”
	•	“We’re working on it”
	•	“Your update is live”

Completion State

When completed:
	•	Show summary of what was changed
	•	Optional link to updated page
	•	Activity entry added:
“Homepage updated with new service copy”

⸻

PART 3 — Internal Workflow View (Critical)

Internal Dashboard: “Change Requests”

Create an internal-only view listing all requests.

Columns:
	•	Site name
	•	Domain
	•	Plan type (Managed / Unlimited)
	•	Request summary
	•	Status
	•	Submitted at
	•	Assigned to (optional)

Default sort:
	•	Unlimited Updates first
	•	Oldest first

⸻

Request Detail View

Clicking a request opens:

Show:
	•	Full request text
	•	Page/URL reference
	•	Uploaded assets
	•	Site link
	•	Active services on the site

Internal controls:
	•	Change status:
	•	queued → in progress → completed
	•	Internal notes (not visible to customer)
	•	Completion summary (visible to customer)

⸻

PART 4 — Completion Behavior (Required)

When a request is marked completed:

System must:
	•	Update request status
	•	Record completion timestamp
	•	Generate activity entry
	•	Notify customer (in-app + optional email)
	•	Unlock “Request a change” for Unlimited plans

⸻

PART 5 — Notifications

In-App
	•	Request received
	•	Request started
	•	Request completed

Email (Phase 1 – Optional)
	•	Only send email on completion
Subject:
“Your website update is live”

Keep copy short and reassuring.

⸻

PART 6 — Guardrails (Very Important)
	•	No SLA countdown timers
	•	No public backlog size
	•	No ability for customers to stack requests
	•	No “urgent” flags
	•	No custom scope negotiation UI

This keeps the promise powerful but safe.

⸻

PART 7 — Data Model (Required)

Create change_requests table:

Fields:
	•	id
	•	site_id
	•	user_id
	•	plan_type
	•	request_text
	•	page_reference
	•	status
	•	internal_notes
	•	completion_summary
	•	created_at
	•	started_at
	•	completed_at

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Customers can request changes easily
	•	Status is always visible
	•	Internal team has a clear work queue
	•	Unlimited promise is enforced cleanly
	•	Completed work feeds the activity system

⸻

Why This Matters

This is the operational backbone of your customization promise.

Without this:
	•	“Unlimited updates” becomes chaos
With this:
	•	It becomes a competitive moat

⸻

Next (after this)

Once this is live, the next obvious workstream is:

👉 Before / After Gallery & Proof of Customization

This visually proves:
	•	sites evolve
	•	customization is real
	•	Arclo is not a static builder
