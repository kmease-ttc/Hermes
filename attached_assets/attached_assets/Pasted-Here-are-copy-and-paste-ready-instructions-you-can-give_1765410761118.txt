Here are copy-and-paste–ready instructions you can give your dev / Replit agent to fix this.

They’re structured as rules for the product, not marketing fluff.

⸻

1. Define the audience in the product

Assume the default user is:
	•	Local business owner (plumber, HVAC, flower shop, cleaner, med spa, etc.)
	•	Not technical
	•	Does not know what “SEO”, “schema”, or “internal links” mean in detail
	•	Only cares about: more calls, more bookings, more foot traffic, more customers

All UI text, headlines, and feature descriptions must be written for that person, not for a marketer or developer.

⸻

2. Global rule for product text

Anywhere user-facing copy appears (headlines, subtitles, feature lists, pricing, in-app explainer text):
	1.	Do not use technical SEO jargon by default:
	•	Remove/avoid terms like:
	•	“programmatic landing pages”
	•	“schema updates / structured data”
	•	“internal linking boosts”
	•	“technical SEO fixes”
	•	“canonical tags”, “H1/H2 optimization”, etc.
	2.	Replace with plain, outcome-based language:
	•	Each feature must answer: “What does this do for my business?”
	3.	If we need to keep technical terms for accuracy, they must:
	•	Be hidden behind a “What’s this?” link, tooltip, or advanced section
	•	Be explained in one short sentence in normal language

⸻

3. Create a “translation map” (must be applied across the UI)

Developer: implement a pass over all product copy (marketing site + app) and replace phrases according to this mapping:
	•	“Arclo creates programmatic landing pages for services/cities”
→ “Arclo automatically creates pages that help you show up in Google for each service you offer in every city you serve.”
	•	“Priority technical SEO fixes”
→ “Arclo fixes the issues that stop customers from finding you on Google.”
	•	“Schema updates / structured data”
→ “Arclo helps Google understand your business, your hours, and your services so you show up more often.”
	•	“Internal linking boosts”
→ “Arclo organizes your pages the way Google likes, so your rankings improve over time.”
	•	“Weekly scheduled enhancements”
→ “Arclo keeps improving your website every week without you doing anything.”
	•	“Arclo creates your entire site, writes your content, fixes SEO issues”
→ “Arclo builds your website, writes your content, and helps you get more customers — automatically.”

Anywhere similar language appears, use this pattern:
tech feature → “so that” → business result.

⸻

4. Rewrite key surfaces (developer tasks)

The dev/agent should specifically:
	1.	Homepage hero
	•	Headline:
	•	From: anything technical
	•	To something like:
“Get a website that brings you more customers — done for you.”
	•	Subheadline:
	•	Explain outcome, not mechanics:
“Arclo builds your site, writes your content, and keeps it updated so more people find and call your business.”
	2.	“What Arclo did for you already” checklist (preview screen)
Replace bullets with outcomes:
	•	“Created 5 SEO-optimized pages”
→ “Built your core pages so customers can quickly see who you are and what you do.”
	•	“Added service-area landing pages”
→ “Added pages to help you show up in Google for each city you serve.”
	•	“Installed technical SEO foundation / schema”
→ “Set things up so Google understands your business details (hours, services, location).”
	•	“Set up internal link structure”
→ “Organized your pages so Google and customers can easily find what they need.”
	•	“Resolved accessibility basics”
→ “Made sure your site works better for everyone, on phones and computers.”
	3.	Pricing / plan feature lists
	•	Remove feature bullets that are just raw jargon.
	•	For each bullet, force this structure:
	•	“[What we do] so that [business outcome].”
Example:
	•	“We publish new articles every month so your business shows up for more Google searches.”

⸻

5. Introduce optional “What’s this?” for advanced users

For users who do care about the technical side:
	•	Under a plain-language line, add a small secondary link:
	•	“What does this include?”
When clicked/hovered, then you can mention:
	•	“We update schema (structured data), fix internal links, and keep your technical SEO healthy.”

But this must never be the primary text.

⸻

6. Guardrails for any new copy

Ask these questions before adding or keeping any phrase in the UI:
	1.	Would a local flower shop owner understand this without Googling it?
	•	If not, rewrite.
	2.	Does this sentence clearly connect to:
	•	more customers
	•	more calls
	•	more bookings
	•	showing up on Google
	•	not having to mess with their website
	•	If not, add the “so that…” part.
	3.	If a term is technical and non-negotiable:
	•	Hide it behind a help icon or advanced section and explain it in one short line.

Dev should enforce these by:
	•	Reviewing all copy for banned words (schema, internal linking, programmatic, canonical, etc.) and replacing them with mapped, outcome-based descriptions.
	•	Creating a small internal “copy style guide” file that lists:
	•	Approved words (customers, calls, bookings, Google, website, pages, etc.)
	•	Disallowed words (schema, canonical, internal link, etc., in user-facing copy)

⸻

7. Primary positioning line (must be used consistently)

Every major surface (homepage hero, onboarding intro, preview page sidebar) should reuse this core statement:

“Arclo builds your website, writes your content, and helps you get more customers — automatically.”

Developer:
	•	Replace any existing tagline that focuses on “AI”, “SEO automation”, “programmatic pages”, etc., with this one core line (or a very close variant).

⸻

8. Acceptance criteria (how dev & you can check it’s done)

The changes are complete when:
	1.	No screen in the app or marketing site shows naked technical jargon without a plain-language explanation right next to it.
	2.	The homepage, plan features, and preview checklist can be read by a non-technical friend (hairdresser, florist, plumber) and they can answer:
	•	“What does Arclo do for me?”
	•	“Why should I care?”
	•	“How does this get me more customers?”
	3.	Nowhere does the copy assume the user is building their own site or doing their own SEO.
	4.	The dominant idea the user sees is:
	•	“Done for you”
	•	“More customers”
	•	“Less work for me”

⸻

You can drop this whole thing into Replit as “Copy & UX Guidelines for Existing Flows,” and tell the dev/agent:

“Apply these rules to the entire marketing site and app UI. Anywhere you see ‘schema’, ‘internal links’, ‘programmatic pages’, or ‘technical SEO’, rewrite it in plain language tied directly to customers, calls, and bookings.”
