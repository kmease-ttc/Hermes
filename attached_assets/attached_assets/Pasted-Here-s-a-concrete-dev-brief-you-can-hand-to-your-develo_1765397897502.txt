Here’s a concrete dev brief you can hand to your developer to evolve Arclo into:

* “Autonomous SEO + Autonomous Website Operations”
* Laser-targeted at service businesses
* Set up for onboarding, retention, and investor story

I’ll break it into sections your dev can work through.

---

## 1. Global Positioning + Navigation

### 1.1 Brand line (used in header, meta, hero)

Replace any generic “AI website engine” language with:

* Primary tagline:
  “Autonomous SEO and website operations for service businesses.”
* Short alt line (for small spaces):
  “AI that runs your website for you.”

### 1.2 Top navigation

Current nav: What We Do, Pricing, Examples, About, Sign In, Generate My Site.

Update labels and ordering:

* What We Do
* How It Works
* Results
* Pricing
* Resources (or Blog, later)
* Sign In
* [Primary CTA] “Generate My Free Site”

Make sure:

* “Generate My Free Site” is visually the primary CTA (button, rightmost).
* All CTAs on the site use **the same** wording for consistency.

---

## 2. Homepage Instructions

Goal: Make it crystal clear that Arclo does **two** things:

1. Creates and runs your website
2. Handles SEO continuously

### 2.1 Hero section

Structure:

* Left column:

  * New headline:
    “Autonomous SEO that builds, runs, and improves your website every day.”
  * Subheadline (2–3 lines):
    “Arclo creates your entire site, writes your content, fixes SEO issues, and keeps everything updated automatically—so local service businesses get more calls without thinking about websites or algorithms.”
  * Primary CTA button: “Generate My Free Site”
  * Secondary CTA (ghost button): “See It in Action”
  * Trust row: “Built for service businesses like” + small pills: “Plumbers · Roofers · Clinics · Attorneys · Home services”

* Right column:

  * Keep the mock browser frame but update overlay labels:

    * “SEO issues fixed daily”
    * “New content published”
    * “Pages optimized for keywords”
    * “Calls and form fills tracked”

Dev notes:

* Update hero copy and CTA labels in `HeroSection` component (or equivalent).
* Update alt text on hero image to mention “Autonomous SEO for service businesses”.

### 2.2 “Who This Is For” strip (immediately under hero)

A narrow, full-width strip:

* Headline: “Made for service businesses that don’t want to think about SEO.”
* Icons + labels:

  * Home services
  * Healthcare clinics
  * Legal & financial
  * Trades (HVAC, plumbing, electrical)

Dev: simple 4-column responsive grid component.

### 2.3 Three Pillars section

Add a section “What Arclo does for you” with 3 cards:

1. “Builds and runs your website”

   * Bullet points:

     * Launches a complete, mobile-friendly site in minutes
     * Sources photos, writes copy, and sets up basic navigation
     * Connects your domain and tracking

2. “Fixes SEO every day”

   * Bullet points:

     * Scans your site for technical issues and broken pages
     * Optimizes titles, meta descriptions, internal links, and schema
     * Creates and updates location + service pages as needed

3. “Shows you the impact in plain English”

   * Bullet points:

     * Simple dashboard: visits, calls, form fills
     * Daily digest: “Here’s what Arclo improved for you”
     * No jargon, no keyword spreadsheets

Dev: reuse existing feature-card component; update icons and copy.

### 2.4 “How It Works” summary on homepage

Short 3-step timeline:

1. “Tell us about your business”

   * Form: services, locations, business name, logo.

2. “We build and deploy your site”

   * The engine generates site, connects domain, sets up tracking.

3. “Arclo runs it every day”

   * AI monitors, fixes SEO, and reports back to you.

Each step with 1–2 bullet points and a small icon.

Link “Learn more” → dedicated “How It Works” page (see section 3).

---

## 3. “What We Do” + “How It Works” Pages

### 3.1 “What We Do” page (Positioning page)

Sections:

1. Intro block

   * Headline: “AI that runs your website like an operator, not a template.”
   * 2–3 paragraphs on the pain: service owners don’t have time for SEO.

2. Two-column “Old Way vs Arclo”

Left: “Without Arclo”

* Pay a designer, copywriter, and SEO agency
* Site gets stale, no one maintains it
* You don’t know what’s working

Right: “With Arclo”

* Site built in a day
* SEO updated continuously
* Simple dashboard + weekly summary

3. “What Arclo actually does every day”

Bullet list grouped under:

* Content
* Technical SEO
* Conversion and UX
* Reporting

Make this explicit so it doesn’t feel like vague AI.

Dev: This is all static content using existing layout components.

### 3.2 “How It Works” page (Technical-ish but friendly)

Structure:

1. Step 1: “We generate your site”

   * Inputs: business name, services, locations, preferred style.
   * Outputs: homepage, service pages, contact page, FAQ, about.

2. Step 2: “We connect your stack”

   * Google Search Console
   * Google Analytics / GA4
   * Call tracking / form tracking (placeholder for now)

3. Step 3: “Arclo’s daily loop”

   * Crawl site
   * Identify issues and opportunities
   * Generate tasks (content updates, new pages, fixes)
   * Apply changes automatically with safety checks

4. Step 4: “You get a plain-English summary”

   * Daily or weekly email: “Today Arclo fixed X, published Y, improved Z.”

Dev: Each step as a full-width row with icon, heading, body text, and a small “See example email” link (open modal later).

---

## 4. Pricing Page Instructions

Goal: Price on value, with clear differentiation and no agency-style complexity.

### 4.1 Tiers

Create 3 simple tiers aimed at service businesses:

1. Launch (for solopreneurs / single-location)
2. Grow (for multi-location/most users)
3. Partner (for agencies / franchises)

Sample structure (your actual $ can change later):

* Launch

  * For: “Single-location service businesses just getting online.”
  * Features:

    * Website build + hosting included
    * Up to X pages
    * Daily SEO checks
    * Weekly email summary
    * Basic support (email)

* Grow

  * For: “Growing businesses who rely on SEO for leads.”
  * Everything in Launch, plus:

    * Unlimited pages
    * Programmatic landing pages for services/cities
    * Priority technical SEO fixes
    * Call + form conversion reporting
    * Chat support

* Partner

  * For: “Agencies and multi-brand operators.”
  * Everything in Grow, plus:

    * Multi-site management
    * White-label reporting
    * Dedicated onboarding
    * Early access to new features

Dev tasks:

* Update tier names, descriptors, and feature bullets in pricing component.
* Add “Best for most” badge to Grow plan.
* Ensure “Generate My Free Site” CTA appears under each tier to keep entry friction low.

---

## 5. Onboarding Flow (Website + Product)

### 5.1 Landing → Free Site Generation

Ensure this funnel is smooth:

Homepage → “Generate My Free Site” button → funnel page:

Form fields (minimum required):

* Business name
* Website (if existing; optional)
* Service category dropdown
* City / region
* Email
* Phone (optional)

Dev: clean single-page form with progress indicator; show clear copy: “No payment, no obligation. We’ll email you a preview.”

### 5.2 Initial dashboard checklist (once site is generated)

When user clicks the “Your site is ready” email and lands in app:

Show a narrow onboarding checklist at top of dashboard:

1. Confirm your business info
2. Connect Google Search Console
3. Connect Analytics
4. Choose your priority services/locations
5. Review and publish site

Each step is clickable and shows a small inline form or modal.

Dev: implement as a small checklist component with 5 items and completion state; store completion flags in user record.

---

## 6. Retention Loops in the App

### 6.1 “Activity Feed” component

Add a section in the logged-in dashboard:

* Title: “What Arclo did for you this week”
* Items like:

  * “Updated 5 page titles for better local keywords”
  * “Published new ‘Water Heater Repair’ page for Austin”
  * “Fixed 2 broken links”
  * “Improved page speed on /services from C to B”

Dev: simple list component; for now you can populate from a mock JSON list; later back it with real events.

### 6.2 Weekly email summary

Product requirement (text dev needs for templates):

Subject line:
“Arclo update: here’s what we improved on your site this week”

Body blocks:

* Summary metric row (visits, calls, form fills, pages improved)
* List of 3–5 key actions Arclo took
* Simple CTA: “Open dashboard”

Dev: integrate with existing SendGrid setup using a scheduled job (can be stubbed for now; at minimum create template and send manually for testing).

---

## 7. SEO Dashboard Specs (Next Feature)

Create a “SEO Dashboard” page under authenticated area with three panels:

1. Overview

   * Cards:

     * Organic visits (30 days)
     * Calls/form fills from organic
     * “Issues fixed” count
   * Trend sparkline for visits.

2. Visibility

   * Top 10 keywords (name + position)
   * Top 10 pages by organic traffic

3. Health

   * Count of outstanding issues:

     * Missing titles
     * 404s
     * Slow pages
   * “Fixes this week” list

Dev:

* For now, mock the data in the UI to finalize layout.
* Ensure filters and layout are responsive and simple.
* Expose an API contract (what data shape the backend needs to send later).

---

## 8. About / Vision (Investor Narrative on Site)

Add an “Our Vision” or “Why Arclo Exists” section on the About page:

Structure:

1. “The problem” – service businesses drowning in websites/SEO they don’t understand.
2. “Our thesis” – websites should be **operated**, not just built; AI makes that possible.
3. “What success looks like” – a world where small businesses never log into a CMS again; Arclo handles it.
4. Short founder note in your voice.

Dev: static content, simple layout; no special functionality.

---

If you paste this into your internal doc as “Arclo Website Dev Brief v1,” your developer can tackle it section by section:

1. Update nav + hero
2. Build homepage sections
3. Build “What We Do” + “How It Works” pages
4. Rework pricing
5. Implement onboarding checklist
6. Implement Activity feed
7. Mock SEO dashboard
8. Update About page narrative

If you’d like, next step I can write exact copy blocks (word-for-word) for each page section so your dev/designer just drop them in.
