Here’s exactly what remains to maximize **your listing score, ranking, and conversion**, now that:

* Photos are cleaned up
* Title is optimized
* Short + long descriptions are rewritten
* Beds are corrected
* Amenities are fixed
* Property type/categories are correct

Below is what’s still left and what will meaningfully move the needle.

---

# **1. Interaction With Guests**

This is still blank and Airbnb *does* rank listings lower for missing communication expectations.

Paste this:

**Interaction with guests**
We give guests space to enjoy the home but are available if anything is needed. Our local team can assist with questions or issues during your stay, and we respond quickly through the Airbnb app. Check in is fully self service using the coded lock.

This takes care of Airbnb’s communication expectations score.

# **2. Strengthen Other Details to Note**

Yours is good, but we can optimize it further for:

* Pool safety
* Camera disclosure
* Stairs
* Neighborhood expectations

Paste this improved version if you want:

**Other details to note**
Exterior security cameras are located at the front entry for safety and monitoring of arrivals only. There are no cameras inside the home or in private outdoor spaces.
The pool and hot tub area is not fenced, so children must be supervised at all times.
Quiet hours in the neighborhood are 10 pm to 8 am.
The garage is not available for guest use.
Guests must be able to climb stairs to access the upstairs bedrooms.

# **3. Add Room Type Privacy Details**

If you click each room (Living Rooms, Bedrooms 1–5), Airbnb lets you add:

* Privacy (door/no door)
* Attached bathroom or not
* Noise notes
* Light notes

This improves guest clarity + boosts the “Listing Quality” score.

I can give you the exact entries for each bedroom if you want.

---

# **4. Add Bedroom Bed Type Details**

Now that bed count is fixed globally, confirm:

* Each bedroom shows the correct bed type
* Bedroom 3 has “Queen bed + Single bunk bed”
* Upstairs master shows “King bed”
* Bedroom 2 shows “2 queen beds”

This prevents guest confusion and improves accuracy ranking.

---

# **5. Add a few space-specific amenities**

Inside the photo tour, Airbnb lets you tag:

* Shuffleboard table
* Arcade table
* Multiple living rooms
* Workspace
* Balcony

Tag all of these — Airbnb uses space-level amenities to surface your home in more searches.

# **6. Optional but High Impact: Add a Custom Link**

Add your **direct booking site** or **Instagram** under “Custom link” to boost off-platform traffic and SEO.

---

# **7. PriceLabs Optimization**

Last step: dial in:

* 0–7 day last-minute discount
* 8–14 day short-window discount
* Min-night rules by day of week
* Far-out premium
* Orphan-night fill rule

This is the #1 way to get your first 5–10 reviews fast and stabilize pricing.

If you open PriceLabs customizations, I’ll tell you exactly what to set.
