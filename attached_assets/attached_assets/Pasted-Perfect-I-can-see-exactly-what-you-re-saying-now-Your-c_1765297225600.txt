Perfect — I can see *exactly* what you’re saying now.

Your current hero example site looks **generic**, muted, and a little “template placeholder-ish.”
What you want is:

### **A highly visual, photographic, emotional example website — the kind of thing a real local business would proudly pay for.**

Something that makes the homepage instantly feel:

* more **human**
* more **premium**
* more **trustworthy**
* more **real-world**
* less “wireframe placeholder”

So here is **the exact creative direction** for your developer (or designer) to produce the hero mockup you’re envisioning:

---

# ✅ **Hero Example Site – “Highly Visual Local Business” Spec**

## **1. Site Theme Options (Pick One)**

Your hero mockup should be one of these visual types (all work great):

### **Option A: Modern Home Services**

* Big photo of a beautiful home exterior
* Clean, calm colors
* Very relatable for contractors, cleaners, landscapers, HVAC, etc.

### **Option B: Restaurant / Coffee Shop**

* Warm lighting
* High-quality food / interior photo
* Very visual, very emotional

### **Option C: Wellness / Spa / Beauty**

* Soft tones
* Portrait photography
* Very premium look

### **Option D: Real Estate**

* Stunning home interior or exterior
* Works for a lot of SMBs

Based on your audience, **Option A or D is strongest**.

# 📸 **2. Hero Image Requirements (VERY IMPORTANT)**

Use a **large, beautiful photograph** spanning the entire hero card inside the mockup.

Must be:

* Wide-angle
* Real-world
* Professionally lit
* Visually interesting
* NOT a pattern or gradient
* NOT muted stock imagery

Examples:

* A modern craftsman home
* A small café with warm ambient lighting
* A relaxing spa environment
* A real estate listing with sunlight coming in

This is what makes the demo website *feel real*.

# 🧱 **3. Example Site Layout Spec for the Mockup**

Inside the mockup:

### **Header**

* Left: Logo + “Home” “Services” “About” “Contact”
* Right: CTA button like “Book Now” or “Get a Quote”

### **Hero Area**

* Full-bleed photo

* Large, bold headline (white text):

  ```
  Professional Service You Can Count On.
  ```

* Subheadline:

  ```
  Serving your community with fast, reliable, high-quality work.
  ```

* Two CTAs:

  * Primary: “Get Started”
  * Secondary: “See Pricing”

### **Styling**

* White text over the photo
* Slight dark gradient overlay behind text
* Rounded corners: 24px
* Subtle drop shadow

---

# ✨ **4. Integrate Floating Value Props (the ones you already love)**

Keep them exactly how you have them — they now wrap around the highly visual hero mockup beautifully.

But make sure they sit **just outside the borders** of the card, not on top of the image.

(This is already looking good in your screenshot — just keep refining spacing.)

---

# 🔍 **5. Problems This Solves**

Switching to a highly visual example site immediately fixes:

* The current mockup being too “placeholder”
* Lack of emotional pull
* The page not feeling local-business-first
* Feeling SaaS-templated rather than premium
* Users not immediately understanding what their website could *look like*

You want users to think:

**“Holy sh*t… if Arclo builds something like THAT automatically, I want this.”**

---

# 🔧 **6. Implementation Instructions for Developer**

Replace the mockup image import:

```tsx
import HeroExample from "/assets/hero/local-visual-example.png";
```

Use this display component:

```tsx
<img
  src={HeroExample}
  alt="Example of a highly visual local business website generated by Arclo"
  className="
    w-full max-w-[560px]
    rounded-3xl shadow-2xl
    object-cover
    animate-float-slow
  "
/>
```

Add a float animation (already close to what you have):

```css
@keyframes float-slow {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0px); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-6px); }
}
.animate-float-slow { animation: float-slow 6s ease-in-out infinite; }
```

# 🎨 **7. I Can Generate the New “Highly Visual Local Business” Mockup for You**

Before I do — I need **one decision from you**:

## **Which visual style should the hero example site use?**

### **A)** A beautiful home exterior (best for contractors / general SMB)

### **B)** A coffee shop / interior (warm, friendly, boutique)

### **C)** A wellness spa / beauty studio (premium, clean)

### **D)** A real estate listing interior/exterior (high visual impact)

Pick **A, B, C, or D**,
and I’ll generate a new hero mockup that looks amazing in your layout and fits your brand.
