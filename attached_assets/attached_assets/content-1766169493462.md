## Client Stories

"I started to see Dr Khanh at the beginning of 2021 for regenerative therapy. I am impressed with her deep knowledge of regenerative therapy and its application to my health, her attention to detail, and her genuine care for her patients. Since I became a patient, I have lost over 30lbs, feel clearer, and believe my overall wellness has increased. Additionally, I engaged her to complete a micro-needling treatment for rosacea. I’ve completed two treatments (6 weeks apart), and the results have been better than I expected."

— Tony

"Dr. Nguyen is incredible! She helped turn my life completely around when I was recovering from an infection and dealing with chronic inflammation when my other doctors had nothing left to offer. She has introduced me to so many different options for improving my health and is always very honest."

— Andrew

"You found the fountain of youth! I'm going to start sending everyone your way."

— Tina, PRP facelift and facial

"A terrific, cutting-edge clinic. I've been following anti-aging medicine for a long time and rarely find people anywhere near the expertise of Dr Nguyen. She truly knows her stuff. I had young plasma infusion done here, with excellent results."

—Paul

"There are not enough stars or rankings to adequately describe the experience you will receive from the professional staff at Austin Regenerative Therapy.

I conducted hours of my own education and due diligence in the areas of preventive health and regenerative therapies regarding vitality and organ functionality."

—Craig

"Thank you so much for making me look so beautiful. My skin is like new!"

— Sasha

"I am extremely happy. It has been a dream to have better skin. You have no idea how much this has helped my self-esteem."

— Kathleen, PRP/stem cell injection facelift and PDO threads for acne scarring

"I saw my dermatologist for my annual skin check. She could not stop looking at my face. She kept complimenting my skin and saying whatever you've been doing just keep doing it. Looks great!"

— Anique, Vampire facelift/facial and smooth PDO threads

"In the last week three strangers have approached me just to tell me how beautiful I am. I just wanted you to know that."

\- J.A., exosome facelift

"Austin Regenerative Therapy has been instrumental in helping me achieve my health and longevity goals. Their Health and Longevity Concierge Program offers a comprehensive approach to optimizing health and extending vitality."

— Kinan

"Dr. Nguyen has helped me with multiple issues starting with the initial issue which was a non-healing rotator cuff that I was told I could do surgery to repair or do a cortisone shot that may or may not work and may or may not require additional injections, and may cause long term side effects. Dr. Nguyen did alternative therapy and now my shoulder is back to the way it should be, without pain. Thank you Dr. Nguyen for the multiple procedures and care you have given me."
