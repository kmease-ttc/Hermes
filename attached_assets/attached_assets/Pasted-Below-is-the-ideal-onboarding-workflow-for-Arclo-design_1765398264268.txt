Below is **the ideal onboarding workflow** for Arclo, designed specifically for:

* **Your target market** → service businesses (plumbers, HVAC, roofers, clinics, attorneys)
* **Your product promise** → *Autonomous SEO + Autonomous Website Operations*
* **Your business goals** → fast conversion, low friction, quick “aha!” moment, high retention.

This is the onboarding flow that will maximize activation, conversions, and trust.

I've broken it into **UX flow**, **copy**, **dev requirements**, and **logic** so your developer can implement it directly.
