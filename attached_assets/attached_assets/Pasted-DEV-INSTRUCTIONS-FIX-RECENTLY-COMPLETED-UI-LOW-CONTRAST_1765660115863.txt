DEV INSTRUCTIONS — FIX “RECENTLY COMPLETED” UI (LOW CONTRAST / GRAY CARDS)

Issue (from screenshot)
The “Recently Completed” section uses gray cards with washed-out text/icons that don’t match the rest of the dashboard. The cards read as disabled and the icon chips don’t pop.

Goal
Make these “completed update” cards look active, readable, and consistent with the app’s dark header + white panel style.

⸻

	1.	Update the card surface + border (stop using flat gray)
Current: medium-gray background with minimal separation.
Fix:

	•	Use a white card surface (or near-white) with a subtle border + shadow.
	•	If you want a “muted completed” look, do it with a thin accent strip or icon chip—not by turning the whole card gray.

Recommended styling (Tailwind-ish; adapt to your tokens)
Card container:
	•	bg-white
	•	border border-slate-200
	•	shadow-sm
	•	rounded-xl
	•	px-5 py-4
Hover (optional):
	•	hover:shadow-md hover:border-slate-300

Spacing:
	•	Ensure consistent gap between icon + text: gap-3

⸻

	2.	Fix typography contrast (title + subtext)
Title text is currently too low contrast.

Title:
	•	text-slate-900 font-medium (or semibold if needed)

Timestamp/subtext:
	•	text-slate-500 text-sm

Make sure the text is never “white on gray” inside a gray card (that’s what’s killing readability).

⸻

	3.	Make the icon chip intentionally branded (not muddy)
Right now the green icon sits on a gray/green chip that feels dull.

Fix:
	•	Use a light tinted background with a clear icon color.
	•	Keep the chip consistent across cards.

Icon chip:
	•	Container: h-9 w-9 rounded-full bg-emerald-500/15 flex items-center justify-center
	•	Icon: text-emerald-600 (or text-emerald-500)

If your brand color is purple, use purple instead and reserve green strictly for “success.”

⸻

	4.	Card layout: keep it simple and consistent
Each card should have:

	•	Left: icon chip
	•	Right: title (1 line) + timestamp (1 line)

Implementation detail
	•	Title should clamp instead of wrapping awkwardly:
	•	line-clamp-1
	•	If the title needs to wrap, allow 2 lines max:
	•	line-clamp-2

⸻

	5.	Optional: add a subtle “Completed” affordance without killing contrast
If you still want these to feel “completed,” add one of:

	•	A small checkmark badge on the top-right (subtle)
	•	A 2px left border accent:
	•	border-l-4 border-l-emerald-400/60
Do NOT gray out the entire card.

⸻

Acceptance criteria
	•	At 100% zoom, the title text is immediately readable without squinting.
	•	Cards no longer look disabled.
	•	Icon is clearly visible and consistent with the rest of the dashboard style.
	•	Visual style matches the “white panel on dark background” pattern used elsewhere.

If you tell me what component file this section lives in (or paste it), I’ll give you the exact className diff to apply.
