Developer instructions: SEO Opportunity Calculator (lead + revenue uplift estimator)

Goal
Add a lightweight “SEO Opportunity Calculator” to arclo.pro that provides immediate value without requiring users to generate a site. The calculator estimates the incremental leads and revenue a business could gain by fixing common technical SEO + on-page issues (canonicals, H1/H2, internal linking, indexing, analytics instrumentation) and applying basic keyword/content alignment.

Primary outcomes
	1.	Capture leads (email optional) before subscription
	2.	Demonstrate ROI in plain English + dollar terms
	3.	Provide a path into “Generate My Free Site” and/or “Start Subscription”

Placement / entry points
	•	Add a new top-nav item: “Calculator”
	•	Add a secondary CTA on the homepage hero: “Estimate SEO ROI”
	•	Add a mid-page section: “Not ready to generate a site? Estimate what SEO fixes are worth for your business.”
	•	URL: /seo-roi-calculator

UX principles
	•	Above the fold: simple inputs, instant results, clear assumptions
	•	Require minimal data (3–5 fields)
	•	No jargon: show “More leads” and “More revenue”
	•	Provide conservative and optimistic ranges (low / expected / high)
	•	Users can get results without providing email; email unlocks a downloadable summary (optional)

Inputs (keep minimal)
Required
	1.	Industry (dropdown)

	•	Options: Professional Services, Home Services, Healthcare, Real Estate, E-commerce, SaaS/B2B, Hospitality, Legal, Other

	2.	Company size (dropdown)

	•	Solo/1–2, 3–10, 11–50, 51–200, 200+

	3.	Current new customers per month (number)

	•	Label as “New customers per month” (not “leads”)
Optional (only if needed to improve accuracy)

	4.	Average revenue per customer (AOV / first-year value) (number)

	•	Label: “Average revenue per new customer”
	•	If blank, use industry default assumptions

	5.	Lead-to-customer conversion rate (percent)

	•	Default to industry baseline; allow override via “Advanced settings”

	6.	Close rate or sales cycle length (advanced, optional)

Assumptions model (transparent and editable)
Define uplift as a range based on “Fixes implemented”:
	•	Technical SEO hygiene (canonicals, headings, indexation, sitemap, internal links): +5–10% organic uplift
	•	Content + keyword alignment (top keywords targeting, on-page optimization, internal linking): +5–15% uplift
	•	Measurement + iteration (GSC/GA4/Clarity + ongoing updates): +2–8% uplift

Total estimated uplift range (cap to stay credible):
	•	Low: 7%
	•	Expected: 15%
	•	High: 25%
Apply uplift to inbound-driven new customers (not all customers). Use industry digital influence factor.

Industry “inbound influence factor” defaults (editable config)
	•	Professional Services: 0.35
	•	Home Services: 0.40
	•	Healthcare: 0.30
	•	Real Estate: 0.25
	•	E-commerce: 0.50
	•	SaaS/B2B: 0.35
	•	Hospitality: 0.30
	•	Legal: 0.30
	•	Other: 0.30

If user provides leads instead of customers (optional future enhancement)
	•	Add toggle: “I know my leads per month” vs “I know my new customers per month”
	•	If leads provided, convert to customers using conversion rate

Core calculation
Let:
C = current new customers/month (input)
V = avg revenue/customer (input or default)
F = inbound influence factor (industry)
Ulow, Uexp, Uhigh = uplift rates (0.07, 0.15, 0.25)

Incremental customers/month:
ΔC = C * F * U

Incremental revenue/month:
ΔR = ΔC * V

Show:
	•	Incremental customers/month (range)
	•	Incremental revenue/month (range)
	•	Incremental revenue/year (range)

Also show breakeven framing:
	•	“If you pay $X/month for Arclo, breakeven is Y new customers/month”
Use current Arclo pricing tiers from config (do not hardcode in UI)

Results display (what the user sees)
Results card with:
	•	“Estimated additional customers/month: +A to +B”
	•	“Estimated additional revenue/month: $X to $Y”
	•	“Estimated additional revenue/year: $X to $Y”
	•	Small “How we estimate this” expandable section listing assumptions and sliders

Include an “Assumptions” accordion
	•	Shows inbound influence factor chosen
	•	Shows uplift range chosen
	•	Provides an optional “Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive” selector that maps to:
	•	Conservative: (0.05, 0.10, 0.18)
	•	Balanced: (0.07, 0.15, 0.25)
	•	Aggressive: (0.10, 0.20, 0.35) capped at 35% and labeled clearly

Lead capture (optional, not required to see results)
After results render, show a minimal inline capture:
	•	“Want a 1-page SEO opportunity summary?” field: email
	•	CTA: “Email my summary”
If email submitted:
	•	Save record + calculator inputs + results
	•	Send email with summary and link back to “Generate My Free Site”

Summary contents (email + on-page printable)
	•	Inputs
	•	Low/Expected/High outputs
	•	Top 5 “likely issues to fix” checklist (generic but helpful):
	1.	Canonical tags
	2.	H1/H2 structure
	3.	Indexing + sitemap + robots sanity check
	4.	Internal linking + keyword targeting
	5.	GA4 + Search Console + Clarity instrumentation

CTAs in results section
Primary: “Generate My Free Site”
Secondary: “See what Arclo fixes automatically”
Tertiary: “Talk to us” (optional) / “View pricing”

Content alignment with Arclo value props
The calculator should directly map to Arclo’s promise:
	•	“Arclo fixes technical SEO issues automatically”
	•	“Arclo updates content weekly”
	•	“Arclo monitors uptime and lead capture”
	•	“Arclo connects Search Console + Analytics + Clarity”
