Below is an updated, consolidated agent prompt / developer instruction set that includes everything you just called out:
	•	Preview iframe and “open in new tab” must show the same site + same assets (hero image + logo mismatch fix)
	•	Header must not cover the preview content (fix layout/offset)
	•	Conversion CTAs must be above the fold on the preview/claim page
	•	Keep the other fixes: remove “Trusted by…”, improve placeholders, industry-correct hero images, real logos, palette-driven accents

No code. This is written as instructions for the Replit agent.

ARCLO AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — PREVIEW CONSISTENCY + CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION (VNext)

Primary Goal

When a user reaches the “Preview Ready” page, the site preview must look identical to the site that opens in a new tab, and the page must be optimized to convert (clear, above-the-fold CTA to claim/purchase).

⸻

1) Preview and New Tab Must Match (Asset Consistency)

Problem

The preview iframe shows different hero image/logo than the live preview opened in a new tab.

Required behavior
	1.	The preview iframe must load the exact same URL and exact same build as “Open Preview in New Tab.”
	2.	The preview iframe must never display a “placeholder build” while the real site shows the final build.

Implementation rules for the agent
	•	Treat the preview site as a single immutable artifact:
	•	One siteId
	•	One buildId (or versionId)
	•	One set of final assets: heroImageUrl, logoUrl, and palette config
	•	Both “iframe preview” and “new tab” must reference the same buildId.

Asset pipeline requirement
	•	After hero and logo are generated and uploaded, the agent must:
	1.	Save final asset URLs to the site config (single source of truth)
	2.	Trigger a rebuild/redeploy of the preview site
	3.	Wait until the deployed preview site serves the updated config
	4.	Only then mark the UI as “Preview Ready”

No partial states
	•	Do not show “Preview Ready” until:
	•	hero image is final and industry-correct
	•	logo is final
	•	preview site has been rebuilt with those assets
	•	If needed, show “Finalizing your preview…” for a few seconds while the deploy catches up.

⸻

2) Fix the Header Overlapping the Preview (Layout Offset)

Problem

On the preview/claim page, the header overlays the top of the preview content, hiding text.

Required behavior
	1.	The preview content area must start below the header (no overlap).
	2.	The preview should look correct at first glance with no scrolling.

Agent instructions
	•	If the header is fixed/sticky:
	•	Add a consistent top offset/padding to the page content equal to the header height.
	•	The offset must be responsive (desktop and mobile header heights may differ).
	•	Validate: when the preview page loads, the preview card title and the top of the preview frame are fully visible.

⸻

3) Conversion CTAs Must Be Above the Fold (Preview/Claim Page)

Problem

The next step (claim/purchase) CTAs are too far down; conversion elements need to be above the fold.

Required behavior (above the fold on desktop)

The first viewport must contain:
	1.	The preview image/frame (or at least the hero portion)
	2.	The “What we already did for you” bullets (short list)
	3.	The primary CTA: Claim / Continue / Purchase (whatever your flow is)
	4.	The secondary CTA: “Not now” or “Tell us why” (optional)

Agent instructions to restructure the page
	•	In the right-hand sidebar:
	•	Move “Ready to claim your website?” and the primary CTA button to the very top of the sidebar.
	•	Keep the checkbox list shorter (5–7 items max) so it doesn’t push CTAs down.
	•	If necessary, compress spacing and reduce font sizes slightly in the sidebar to keep CTA visible without scrolling.

CTA copy requirement (plain language)

Use benefit-driven text:
	•	Button: “Claim My Website” or “Launch My Website”
	•	Supporting line: “Love this preview? Claim it and we’ll keep improving it automatically.”

⸻

4) Hero Image Must Match the Industry (and Never Be “Coding” for HVAC)

Problem

The preview sometimes shows a non-industry image even though the live new-tab view is correct.

Required behavior
	1.	The hero image is generated from an industry template prompt, not generic prompts.
	2.	A relevance check must run before accepting the hero.
	3.	If the hero fails relevance, regenerate with stronger constraints or fallback to curated industry imagery.

Agent instructions
	•	For HVAC, explicitly forbid:
	•	coding
	•	laptops
	•	office desks
	•	corporate interiors
	•	Add a simple “industry relevance check” step:
	•	If image is wrong, reject and regenerate.

Most important: the hero image that passes the check is what gets written to the site config, and both iframe/new tab must use it via the single buildId.

⸻

5) Logo Must Be Visible Everywhere (Preview + New Tab)

Problem

Logo shows up in the full site but not in the preview iframe.

Required behavior
	•	The logo must be part of the same site config used by both views.
	•	The logo must not be swapped out by a preview-only placeholder or default.

Agent instructions
	•	Logo generation is required.
	•	Save logoUrl into the site config before deploy.
	•	If logo generation fails:
	•	use a text wordmark fallback (business name + palette styling)
	•	still deploy
	•	but schedule a logo regeneration retry in the background (without blocking the preview)

⸻

6) Remove “Trusted by [X] Customers” Pill Completely

Required behavior
	•	Remove the “Trusted by…” element entirely from all templates.
	•	Replace with a row of 3 credibility badges that match the industry OR remove the element completely.

Also ensure there are no hard-coded purple accents left behind.

⸻

7) Replace the Bullseye Placeholder Illustration

Required behavior
	•	Replace generic placeholder icons with:
	•	industry-matching icons/illustrations, or
	•	a simple generated flat illustration that matches palette colors

Agent instructions:
	•	Create an “illustration pack” per industry (HVAC, plumbing, bakery, etc.)
	•	Use those icons consistently in “Our Approach” and “Services” sections.

⸻

8) Final “Preview Ready” Quality Gate

Before marking Preview Ready, the agent must confirm:
	1.	Preview iframe URL == New tab URL (same buildId/version)
	2.	Hero image is industry-correct and present in both
	3.	Logo is present in both
	4.	Header does not overlap any preview content
	5.	Primary CTA to claim/purchase is visible above the fold
	6.	No “Trusted by…” pill exists
	7.	Placeholder imagery looks intentional (no bullseye)

If any check fails:
	•	do not show “Preview Ready”
	•	show “Finalizing preview…”
	•	fix and redeploy
	•	then mark ready
