Perfect — here is exactly what needs to happen to polish the hero section, remove the Empathy Health Clinic screenshot, and replace it with a **generic but beautiful example site** that:

1. Looks premium
2. Appeals to *any* local business
3. Doesn’t pigeonhole Arclo into one vertical
4. Works perfectly with your floating value props

Below are the **developer-ready instructions** plus the **creative direction** for the new hero image.

---

# ✅ **Hero Section Update — Developer Instructions**

## **1. Remove the Empathy Health Clinic mockup**

Replace the screenshot with a **neutral, beautiful example website** that looks like something Arclo would generate.

The example site should be *fictional* and *industry-agnostic*.

---

# 🎨 **2. Use This Visual Direction for the New Hero Example**

### **New Example Site Theme**

A clean, modern “local business” website. Could be:

* A home services company
* A wellness clinic
* A real estate professional
* A generic service provider

But avoid anything that clearly references *your actual brands*.

### **Mockup Structure (recommended)**

A premium look like this:

**Header (inside mockup)**

* Logo placeholder
* Nav items: Home · Services · About · Contact
* Rounded CTA: “Book Now” or “Get Free Quote”

**Hero image inside mockup**

* Beautiful local landscape / neutral service image
* Slight gradient overlay for readability

**Headline inside mockup**

```
Professional Service You Can Count On.
```

**Subcopy**

```
Serving the community with fast, reliable, high-quality work.
```

**CTA row**

* "Get Started"
* "See Pricing"

### **Color palette inside mockup**

* Blues & neutrals (safe for global audiences)
* High contrast, clean
* Rounded corners: 24px radius

### **Export specs**

* Transparent PNG
* 1600×1000 or similar
* Soft shadow
* No hard background edges

---

# ✨ **3. Preserve the Floating Value Props (They Look Great)**

Keep the four floating tags you already have — they are *chef’s kiss* for perceived value.

Suggested arrangement in final hero:

* **Top left:** “Site Improved Daily ✓”
* **Top right:** “Content Written ✓”
* **Bottom right:** “SEO Issues Fixed ✓”
* **Bottom left:** “Pages Generated ✓”

BUT — make sure they orbit the *new generic mockup*, not a real clinic site.

---

# 🔧 **4. Technical Instructions for Your Developer**

### Replace the mockup image import:

```tsx
import HeroExample from "/assets/hero/example-mockup.png";
```

### Update the `<img>` in the hero:

```tsx
<img
  src={HeroExample}
  alt="Example website created automatically by Arclo"
  className="w-full max-w-[520px] rounded-3xl shadow-2xl"
>
```

### Ensure floating tags stay consistent:

```tsx
<div className="absolute top-8 left-4 ...">Site Improved Daily ✓</div>
<div className="absolute top-8 right-4 ...">Content Written ✓</div>
<div className="absolute bottom-8 right-4 ...">SEO Issues Fixed ✓</div>
<div className="absolute bottom-8 left-4 ...">Pages Generated ✓</div>
```

### Keep spacing consistent

Make sure the mockup sits slightly inset into the hero card with:

* `pt-8` above mockup
* `pb-8` below
* Ensure no background seams

---

# ⭐ **5. Optional Improvements to Make the Hero Pop**

These will make it look even more premium:

### Add a soft gradient glow behind the mockup:

```
bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_center,_rgba(79,70,229,0.15),_transparent_60%)]
```

### Add a subtle float animation to the mockup:

```css
animate-[float_6s_ease-in-out_infinite]
```

### Light drop-shadow for floating tags:

```
shadow-[0_8px_16px_rgba(0,0,0,0.08)]
```

It will be:

* Industry-neutral
