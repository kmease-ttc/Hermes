I can’t see the live layout of arclo.pro from here (the HTML is being rendered almost entirely by client-side JS), so I’m going to treat this like a full productized SaaS site review from first principles and give you a concrete “head of UX” punch-list you can hand your dev/designer.

I’ll assume:
	•	Arclo = autonomous SEO + website generation for SMBs/marketers
	•	You want: credibility, clarity, and signups (free trial / demo / waitlist / purchase).

I’ll structure this as: principle → exact instructions for your dev.

⸻

1. Overall Story & Structure

Principle: Above all, the site has to answer three questions in 5 seconds:
	1.	What is this?
	2.	Who is it for?
	3.	What do I do next?

Dev instructions:
	•	Make sure the page follows a standard high-converting SaaS structure:
	1.	Hero (clarity + social proof + primary CTA)
	2.	“How it works” in 3–4 steps (with visuals)
	3.	Outcomes/value (metrics and benefits, not just features)
	4.	Detailed feature sections
	5.	Pricing (simple, 2–3 plans max)
	6.	Social proof (logos, quotes, results)
	7.	Final CTA section (“Ready to put SEO on autopilot?”)
	•	Keep each section visually distinct with background shifts (white / very light gray / very dark band) so the scroll feels intentional, not like a long wall of text.

⸻

2. Navigation & Information Architecture

Principle: Nav should be minimal and conversion-oriented.

Dev instructions:
	•	Limit top nav to 4–5 max primary items:
	•	Product
	•	Pricing
	•	Resources (or “How it Works”)
	•	About (optional)
	•	CTA button: “Start free” / “Request access”
	•	Make the primary CTA a contrasting button on the right; everything else text-only.
	•	On mobile:
	•	Collapse to a hamburger.
	•	Keep the primary CTA visible either as a button in the header or as a sticky bottom bar (“Start free in 2 minutes”).

If you’ve currently got extra items (Blog, Docs, etc.) in the header, move them into:
	•	Footer, or
	•	A “Resources” dropdown.

⸻

3. Hero Section

Principle: Clarity > cleverness. One hero, one primary action.

Dev instructions:
	•	Headline formula: [Outcome] with [distinct mechanism]
	•	Example: “Autonomous SEO that designs, builds, and optimizes your site for you.”
	•	Subhead: 1–2 short sentences clarifying who it’s for and what’s unique.
	•	Example: “Arclo watches your rankings, builds new pages, and keeps your site optimized—so you can focus on running your business, not chasing algorithms.”
	•	CTAs:
	•	Primary: “Start free audit” or “Generate my first site”
	•	Secondary (text link under button): “Watch 2-minute demo”
	•	Visual:
	•	Replace any flat gradient or generic pattern with:
	•	A real product mockup (browser window showing Arclo dashboard / generated site), or
	•	A split: left = copy; right = stacked screenshots/cards showcasing “Before/After” SEO visibility or traffic.
	•	Add social proof above the fold:
	•	Example: “Trusted by X websites” or logos of your 3 internal brands in grayscale.

⸻

4. Visual Design & Layout

Principle: Opinionated, consistent system. Avoid “template” vibes.

Dev instructions:
	•	Typography:
	•	Set a clear type scale:
	•	H1: 36–48px
	•	H2: 28–32px
	•	H3: ~22–24px
	•	Body: 16–18px
	•	Limit to 1–2 font families (e.g., headline + body).
	•	Line length target ~60–80 chars on desktop; don’t let text run full width.
	•	Spacing:
	•	Use a consistent spacing scale (4/8 px multiples).
	•	Each major section should have at least 80–120px vertical padding on desktop, 48–64px on mobile.
	•	Color:
	•	Define a palette:
	•	Primary brand color (for CTAs and key highlights).
	•	One accent color for charts/illustrations.
	•	Neutral grays (3–4 steps) for backgrounds, borders, text.
	•	CTAs must have high contrast against background; avoid muted buttons.
	•	Cards & hierarchy:
	•	Use cards for features, plans, and steps with:
	•	16–24px padding
	•	8–16px border radius
	•	Soft shadow or subtle border
	•	Always visually emphasize the main action/plan with a different background or border.

If anything currently feels like “plain text on white,” wrap that content in cards or use contrasting sections.

5. Copy & Messaging

Principle: Benefits first, features second, jargon last.

Dev instructions:
	•	Rewrite all section headings so they read as outcomes, not features:
	•	Instead of “Automated Content Generation” → “New content for every opportunity.”
	•	Instead of “SEO Reporting” → “Know exactly which pages are paying off.”
	•	For each feature:
	•	Use a 3-line pattern:
	•	Short, outcome-oriented title.
	•	1-sentence benefit.
	•	One supporting detail or example.
	•	Avoid vague claims like “AI-powered” unless tied to a tangible benefit:
	•	“AI builds SEO-ready pages overnight while you sleep.”

You can feed your dev/editor a content checklist: every section should answer “so what?” in the first sentence.

6. “How It Works” Section

Principle: Reduce anxiety and mental load with a clear path.

Dev instructions:
	•	Add a “How Arclo works” strip with 3–4 steps:
	1.	Connect your site / domain.
	2.	Arclo runs an SEO & content audit.
	3.	It proposes new pages + changes.
	4.	You approve and publish.
	•	Each step gets:
	•	Icon or small illustration.
	•	Short heading.
	•	1–2 lines of copy max.
	•	If you have approvals/guardrails, highlight them (“You always approve before anything goes live”).

⸻

7. Pricing & Plans

Principle: Simple, scannable, and anchored to value.

Dev instructions:
	•	Stick to 2 or 3 plans:
	•	Starter (for solo site owners).
	•	Growth (main, highlighted plan).
	•	Pro/Agency (for bigger accounts).
	•	Each plan card should show:
	•	Monthly price.
	•	“Best for…” description.
	•	3–5 bullet benefits.
	•	CTA: “Start free” or “Talk to us.”
	•	Visually highlight 1 plan as “Most popular” with a label + slightly larger card.
	•	If you charge per number of keywords/pages/sites, show this as a simple table row, not dense text.

If current pricing feels confusing or cramped, use a single column layout on mobile and avoid extensive fine print.

⸻

8. Social Proof, Trust, and Risk Reversal

Principle: Reduce perceived risk; show real humans and outcomes.

Dev instructions:
	•	Add at least one of:
	•	Testimonials (even if from your own brands, clearly labeled).
	•	Before/after analytics screenshots (blur numbers if needed).
	•	“What you get in the first 30 days” with concrete expected outputs.
	•	Include trust markers:
	•	“Powered by OpenAI, Cloudflare, SendGrid, …” (use their logos) in a band near the hero or footer.
	•	Security/privacy commitments as a small section in the footer (“Your data and content stay yours. We do X/Y to keep it safe.”).
	•	Add a short FAQ section addressing:
	•	“Will Arclo change my live site without approval?”
	•	“What if I already have an SEO agency?”
	•	“Can I cancel any time?”

⸻

9. Forms & Conversion Flows

Principle: Less friction, more clarity.

Dev instructions:
	•	Primary CTA should take the user to:
	•	A short signup form, or
	•	A “create my site / audit” flow.
	•	For first touch, limit fields to:
	•	Name
	•	Email
	•	Website URL
	•	Optional: company size or role
	•	Show what happens next directly on the button page:
	•	“In the next 10 minutes we’ll: 1) crawl your site, 2) identify top 10 urgent fixes, 3) email you a report.”
	•	Use inline validation, clear error messages, and success states (e.g., simple confirmation screen with timeline).

If you have multiple CTAs (demo, waitlist, audit), make sure one is visually primary and the others secondary.

⸻

10. Mobile & Responsiveness

Principle: Design for mobile first; many early users will check on phone.

Dev instructions:
	•	Check every section at:
	•	375px width (iPhone),
	•	768px width (iPad).
	•	Ensure:
	•	No text < 14px.
	•	Hero copy fits without awkward line breaks.
	•	Buttons are at least 44px tall with generous tap area.
	•	Images reflow under text (not tiny thumbnails).
	•	Consider a sticky bottom CTA on mobile:
	•	“Run free SEO scan” with a single tap.

⸻

11. Accessibility & Basics

Principle: Meet at least WCAG AA basics.

Dev instructions:
	•	Check color contrast (use a contrast checker) for:
	•	Text vs background.
	•	Buttons vs background.
	•	Ensure:
	•	All interactive elements are reachable by keyboard (tab order).
	•	Links and buttons are visually distinct.
	•	Images and icons have alt text or aria-hidden where appropriate.
	•	Headings follow logical order (h1 → h2 → h3).
	•	Don’t rely solely on color to communicate states (e.g., add icons/labels for errors).

⸻

12. Performance & Perceived Speed (UX side)

Principle: Fast feels trustworthy and modern.

Dev instructions (non-SEO but UX relevant):
	•	Optimize hero images & screenshots:
	•	Use modern formats (WebP/AVIF) and proper sizes.
	•	Avoid heavy animations or giant Lottie files above the fold.
	•	Use skeleton loaders or subtle shimmer effects for any async data (e.g., if you show live metric examples) instead of blank gaps.

If you paste me the current hero copy + section headings (or screenshots), I can turn this into a very specific “v1 → v2” diff (old text/new text, old layout/new layout) that your dev can implement line by line. After this UX pass, we can go straight into a technical SEO checklist tailored to Arclo’s stack.
