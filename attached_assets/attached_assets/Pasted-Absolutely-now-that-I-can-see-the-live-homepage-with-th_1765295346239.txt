Absolutely — now that I can **see the live homepage with the new mockup**, I can give you highly specific, **designer-level guidance** to push it from “good” → **“premium, polished, and conversion-ready.”**

Below is **real, actionable design critique**, not generic advice.

---

# ⭐ **TOP-LEVEL FEEDBACK — What’s Working**

✔ The new dark hero background feels premium and modern
✔ The mockup is strong — finally conveys “your site will look great”
✔ Floating automation labels visually express the AI value
✔ Headline is clear and powerful
✔ Overall spacing is improved

This is now a *legit* SaaS hero — you’re close.

But…

To compete with Webflow / Framer / Notion / Linear, we need refinement in **four key areas**:

---

# 🔥 **1. The Mockup Needs More Presence & Weight**

Right now the mockup feels:

* slightly small
* slightly low contrast
* too far down the page
* too “pasted in”

**Fixes:**

### ✔ Increase mockup size by ~20–25%

Make it dominate the right side of the hero.

### ✔ Raise it upward slightly

Right now there's too much empty space between CTA & mockup.

### ✔ Add a subtle “glass reflection” or highlight

This gives it a premium device-mockup feel.

### ✔ Slight vignette behind the mockup

Very faint, like:

```
0 0 140px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)
```

This will separate it from the background and make it pop.

---

# 🔥 **2. The Floating Automation Tags Need Stronger Visual Hierarchy**

They’re good — but they feel:

* “just placed wherever”
* too similar in style
* too lightly weighted

We want them to feel **intentional**, not random.

**Fixes:**

### ✔ Make one tag the “hero tag”

Example:

**Site Improved Daily ✓**
→ Slightly larger
→ Positioned closer to the mockup
→ Reinforces your USP

### ✔ Reduce opacity of secondary tags

Use:

* Primary: full opacity
* Secondary: 85% opacity

Creates hierarchy.

### ✔ Align tags along a loose arc

Make them feel like they orbit the mockup.

This subconsciously says *“AI is actively doing work around your site.”*

---

# 🔥 **3. Typography Needs More Hero Presence**

Your headline is strong but visually:

* spacing is slightly tight
* the line breaks aren’t optimized
* the subheadline feels small and washed out

**Fixes:**

### ✔ Increase headline line height by ~4–6px

More breathing room = premium.

### ✔ Use a more intentional line break:

Instead of:

Grow Your Business With
an AI Website That Runs
Itself.

Try:

Grow Your Business
With an AI Website
That Runs Itself.

Cleaner. More symmetrical.

### ✔ Boost subheadline opacity (currently too faint)

Use:

`rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` instead of `0.65`.

### ✔ Slightly increase the subheadline font size

From **16 → 18 or 19px**.

This dramatically boosts perceived quality.

---

# 🔥 **4. Whitespace & Layout Rhythm**

This is the biggest area where “cheap vs premium” is determined.

Your hero currently suffers from:

* slightly uneven vertical spacing
* CTA row feels cramped
* reassurance line looks like an afterthought

**Fixes:**

### ✔ Add 12–16px vertical padding between CTA buttons

Let them breathe.

### ✔ Add subtle spacing above the reassurance line

Right now it hugs too tightly → feels unfinished.

### ✔ Increase top padding of hero section

Move the whole hero down ~40px.

This prevents the headline from suffocating against the navbar.

# ⭐ BONUS: **Optional but Massive Upgrade Ideas**

## 🎨 Add a soft gradient flare behind the headline

Very subtle — not cheesy.

Indigo → blue → transparent
Opacity 10–12%

This adds “energy.”

## 💡 Add extremely subtle micro-animations

Examples:

* mockup floats 1–2px on a 6-second loop
* tags fade in and out gently
* background gradient rotates 2 degrees over 15 seconds

This makes the hero feel *alive* and premium.

## 🧱 Add a faint grid or noise texture to the background

Right now the dark navy is a little flat.

Texture = sophistication.

---

# ⭐ **Want me to generate a BEFORE/AFTER mockup so you can show your developer exactly what to change visually?**

I can:

* produce a polished hero redesign concept
* show improved spacing / mockup size / tag layout
* export it as a PNG or layered composition
* give pixel-perfect measurements for the dev

Just say:

**“Yes — redesign the hero concept visually.”**
