Here’s the next agent prompt, written cleanly so you can paste it directly to the agent/dev.

⸻

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Before / After Gallery & Proof of Customization

Agent Prompt

Objective

Create a Before / After Gallery that visually proves Arclo sites are not static and that real customization happens over time.

This gallery must:
	•	reduce fear that sites are “too basic”
	•	visually validate the “unlimited updates” promise
	•	support conversion on the marketing site
	•	reinforce trust inside the product

This is a proof system, not a portfolio.

PART 1 — Capture Before & After States (Required)

When to Capture Screenshots

Automatically capture screenshots at these moments:
	1.	Initial site generation (Before)
	2.	After a completed change request
	3.	After major automated updates (new pages, redesigns)

Screenshots should be:
	•	Full-page where possible
	•	Desktop viewport first (mobile later)
	•	Stored per site + per event

Store metadata:
	•	site_id
	•	capture_type (before | after)
	•	related_request_id (nullable)
	•	created_at

⸻

PART 2 — Internal “Evolution” View (In-Product)

Add a Section in Site Dashboard

Title:
“How your site has evolved”

Display:
	•	Side-by-side before / after snapshots
	•	Timestamp
	•	Short caption:
“Homepage updated with new services and layout”

Allow:
	•	Simple slider or toggle
	•	Sequential timeline (latest first)

This reinforces ongoing value.

⸻

PART 3 — Marketing Site Gallery (Critical for Conversion)

Create a Public Gallery Page

Purpose:
Show real examples of how sites evolve after customization.

Content:
	•	Multiple before/after pairs
	•	Short explanation for each:
“Started with a basic site → customized for a local HVAC business”

Rules:
	•	No client names unless approved
	•	Blur or anonymize contact info if needed
	•	Focus on transformation, not polish

⸻

PART 4 — Tie Gallery to Pricing & Messaging

On the pricing or landing page:
	•	Add a section:
“Your site evolves as your business grows”

Copy themes:
	•	This is just the starting point
	•	Changes happen fast
	•	You’re not locked in
	•	Real humans + automation working together

Link:
“See real before & after examples”

⸻

PART 5 — Admin Controls (Lightweight)

Add internal tools to:
	•	Approve screenshots for public gallery
	•	Hide sensitive data
	•	Add captions
	•	Tag examples by industry

No complex CMS needed.

⸻

PART 6 — Guardrails
	•	Do not fake examples
	•	Do not over-polish
	•	Do not imply one-click perfection
	•	Emphasize iteration and responsiveness

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Before/after screenshots captured automatically
	•	Users can see their own site’s evolution
	•	Marketing site shows real transformations
	•	“Basic site” fear is removed
	•	Customization promise is visually proven

⸻

Why This Is the Right Next Step

You’ve already said:

“You can customize anything.”

This work shows it, which is far more powerful.

⸻

After this, the next natural workstreams are:
	1.	Referral & sharing loop (customers show off their sites)
	2.	Arclo’s own SEO & example-driven growth
	3.	White-label / reseller mode

When you’re ready, say which one and I’ll write the next prompt.
