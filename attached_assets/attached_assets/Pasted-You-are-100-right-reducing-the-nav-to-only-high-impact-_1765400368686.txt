You are **100% right** — reducing the nav to only *high-impact items* is the fastest way to make the header feel premium, intentional, and uncluttered.

Service businesses don’t need a giant menu.
They need clarity, speed, and one obvious next step.

Right now you have:

* What We Do
* How It Works
* Results
* Pricing
* Resources
* Sign In
* CTA

That’s way too many for a hero-focused SaaS homepage.

Below are **the streamlined nav patterns used by the highest-performing SaaS companies**, and exactly what yours should be.

# ⭐ BEST OPTION (Recommended)

### **Ultra-Clean, High-Conversion Nav for Arclo**

```
Arclo      Product    Pricing    Results    Resources    Sign In    [Generate My Free Site]
```

### Why this works:

✔ Removes redundancy (“What We Do” vs “How It Works” = same concept)
✔ “Product” is the one-word umbrella for all functional education
✔ Keeps “Results” because service businesses care about proof
✔ Keeps “Pricing” because it’s a high-intent conversion click
✔ “Resources” houses blog, FAQs, examples
✔ “Sign In” stays small
✔ CTA is the only loud element — which is exactly what you want

This is the **sweet spot** for clarity + conversion.

# ⭐ EVEN CLEANER (If you want maximum simplicity)

### **4-item nav:**

```
Arclo      Product    Pricing    Resources    Sign In    [Generate My Free Site]
```

### Why this works:

✔ Highest signal-to-noise
✔ Feels like Notion / Linear / Vercel — premium & modern
✔ Perfect for early-stage positioning
✔ Your homepage already explains results + how it works

---

# ⭐ NICHE-FOCUSED (If you want to lean into service businesses hard)

```
Arclo      For Service Businesses    Product    Pricing    Sign In    [Generate My Free Site]
```

This is psychologically very powerful because it instantly tells the plumber/HVAC/roofer:

> “Yes, this is built specifically for you.”

But it is more wordy.

---

# ⭐ THE ONE YOU SHOULD **NOT** KEEP

“What We Do”
“How It Works”
at the same time.

That is always redundant.
Pick *one*.

Between the two, **“Product”** is stronger.

Because:

* It’s familiar SaaS language
* It encompasses capability + workflow
* It’s shorter
* It’s scannable
* It’s what buyers expect to click

# ✅ **FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU (Best Blend of Simplicity + Conversion)**

👉 **Use this exact nav:**

```
Arclo      Product    Pricing    Results    Resources    Sign In    [Generate My Free Site]
```

If you want it even cleaner:

```
Arclo      Product    Pricing    Resources    Sign In    [Generate My Free Site]
```

# 🧩 Developer Instructions (Drop-In Ready)

In `HeaderNav.tsx` (or wherever your nav items live), replace the items array with:

```tsx
const navItems = [
  { label: "Product", href: "/product" },
  { label: "Pricing", href: "/pricing" },
  { label: "Results", href: "/results" },
  { label: "Resources", href: "/resources" },
];
```

or the ultra-clean:

```tsx
const navItems = [
  { label: "Product", href: "/product" },
  { label: "Pricing", href: "/pricing" },
  { label: "Resources", href: "/resources" },
];
```

Ensure “Sign In” is styled as a subdued text link in the far right, and “Generate My Free Site” stays as the dominant pill button.
