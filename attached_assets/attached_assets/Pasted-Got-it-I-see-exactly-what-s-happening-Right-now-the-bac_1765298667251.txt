Got it — I see *exactly* what’s happening.

Right now the **background gradient + glow blob** sitting *above* the “COMING SOON TO ARCLO” heading is slightly too strong, too high, and too close to white. This causes:

* a **hotspot** effect (looks like a light shining directly above the text)
* inconsistent blending with the rest of the gradient
* a visual **cut line** between the hero/upper content and the roadmap section
* the appearance that the gradient “band” is separate instead of one continuous surface

The fix is simple: **dial back the glow opacity and reposition the gradient stop lower** so it blends smoothly into the darker portion below.

Below are *clean, developer-ready corrections*.

---

# ✅ **Fix #1 — Reduce Glow Opacity**

Your current glow layer is too strong (`opacity-100` → `opacity-60`).
Use more subtle color:

### Replace:

```tsx
bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top,_rgba(255,255,255,0.7),_transparent_70%)]
```

### With:

```tsx
bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top,_rgba(255,255,255,0.25),_transparent_75%)]
opacity-60
```

**Why it works:**
This removes the harsh “spotlight” and makes the gradient feel natural.

---

# ✅ **Fix #2 — Lower the Glow Position**

Right now the glow is centered too close to the text.
Shift it *upward* and *expand* it so the hotspot is off-screen.

### Replace:

```tsx
absolute inset-x-0 top-0 h-40
```

### With:

```tsx
absolute inset-x-0 -top-32 h-64
```

**Why it works:**
You still get a beautiful glow — but the bright spot is above the viewport, diffused by the gradient.

---

# ✅ **Fix #3 — Use a Multi-Stop Gradient Instead of a Hard Fade**

Your current gradient has only two stops, so the light area feels abrupt.

Switch to a smoother 3–4 stop gradient:

```tsx
bg-gradient-to-b 
  from-white 
  via-slate-50 
  via-slate-100/80 
  to-[#181857]
```

This makes the entire section flow seamlessly into the dark footer.

---

# ✅ **Fix #4 — Add a Very Subtle Texture Layer (Optional but Amazing)**

A light noise pattern eliminates banding and makes the glow feel “real.”

```tsx
<div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 bg-[url('/noise.png')] opacity-[0.03]"></div>
```

This is the same technique used by Linear, Raycast, and Vercel.

# 🧩 **Final Recommended Code Block (Ready for your Dev)**

```tsx
<section className="relative py-24 md:py-32 bg-gradient-to-b from-white via-slate-50 via-slate-100/80 to-[#181857]">

  {/* Soft top glow */}
  <div
    className="
      pointer-events-none absolute inset-x-0 
      -top-32 h-64 
      bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top,_rgba(255,255,255,0.25),_transparent_75%)]
      opacity-60 blur-2xl
    "
  />

  {/* Optional noise texture */}
  <div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 bg-[url('/noise.png')] opacity-[0.03]" />

  <div className="relative max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-8 text-center">
    {/* ROADMAP LABEL + HEADING + CONTENT GOES HERE */}
  </div>
</section>
```

---

# 🎯 **This Will Fix:**

* the too-bright hotspot
* the slightly awkward boundary above "Coming Soon"
* the uneven transition into the darker content
* the feeling that the glow is “in front” of the heading

Your section will now have the same polished, premium look as the hero and stats sections.

---

If you want, I can also apply:

* a parallax motion to the glow
* a shifting Aurora-style gradient
* faint diagonal light beams (super subtle, modern SaaS aesthetic)

Just tell me:
**“Make the glow animated”** or **“Add an Aurora effect.”**
