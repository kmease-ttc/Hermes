Here’s a single, clean prompt you can give directly to your Replit agent / AI editor to make the right additions to the pricing page—without changing the structure, adding new plans, or introducing SEO jargon.

This prompt assumes the agent can read and modify the existing /pricing page.

PROMPT: Enhance Pricing Page to Clarify “Getting Found on Google” (Plain Language, No Jargon)

You are improving the existing Arclo pricing page.
Do not redesign the page or add new plans.
Do not introduce technical SEO jargon (keywords, schema, internal links, etc.).

Your goal is to make it crystal clear that Arclo already helps businesses get found on Google, in language a non-technical local business owner understands.

Constraints
	•	Keep the page simple and scannable.
	•	No new pricing tiers.
	•	No add-ons.
	•	No SEO buzzwords.
	•	Focus on outcomes: customers, searches, visibility, calls, leads.
	•	Assume the reader is a plumber, HVAC tech, baker, or florist.

⸻

1. Add a New Section Below the Pricing Cards

Insert a new section directly below the pricing plans with the heading:

“How Arclo Helps Customers Find You on Google”

Section copy:

Arclo is designed to help your business show up when people search for what you offer.

We handle everything automatically — you don’t need to pick keywords, manage SEO, or update your site.

Bullet points (exact intent, wording can be lightly refined):
	•	We create pages for the services you offer
	•	We create pages for the areas and cities you serve
	•	We improve and expand those pages over time
	•	We adjust things automatically based on what’s working
	•	We keep your site fresh so Google continues to trust it

End the section with a reassurance line:

You focus on running your business. Arclo handles the rest.

⸻

2. Add a Subtle Tooltip or “Learn More” on the Grow Plan

On the Grow plan (the primary plan), find the bullet that mentions showing up on Google or getting more customers.

Add a small “Learn more” or tooltip next to it.

Tooltip content (plain language):

We focus on the searches real customers use — like your services and your location.

Arclo builds and improves pages around those searches automatically, so more people can find you.

Do not mention keywords, rankings, or SEO mechanics.

⸻

3. Slightly Strengthen the Partner Plan Positioning (No New Features)

Without adding new bullets, adjust the tone of the Partner plan description to emphasize scale and intensity, not technical detail.

Add or refine one line to communicate:

Designed for businesses that want faster, more aggressive growth across more services or locations.

Keep this high-level and outcome-focused.

⸻

4. Optional FAQ at the Bottom of the Page

If there is already an FAQ section, add this question.
If not, add a very small FAQ block at the bottom.

Q: Do I need to choose keywords or manage SEO myself?
A:

No. Arclo focuses on your services and your location and handles everything automatically.

You don’t need to understand SEO — you’ll just see more customers finding you.

⸻

5. Final Validation Checklist

Before finishing, confirm:
	•	No technical SEO terms appear anywhere in the new copy.
	•	The page still feels simple and uncluttered.
	•	A non-technical business owner could clearly answer:
	•	“Does this help people find me on Google?”
	•	“Do I need to manage anything myself?” (answer should feel like “no”)

Only make these additions if they improve clarity without increasing complexity.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	rewrite the entire pricing page copy end-to-end in this same voice, or
	•	generate an A/B test variant of the pricing page that emphasizes “customers” even more strongly.
