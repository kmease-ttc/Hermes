Here are the exact prompts for AI image generation you need for Arclo’s website generator.
These will reliably produce premium hero images, section backgrounds, and supporting visuals that look like a high-end, professionally designed site.

They are written in a way that works for OpenAI Images, Midjourney, Replicate, Stable Diffusion XL, or any other system you plug in.

You can copy/paste these directly into your codebase as your generation templates.

1. HERO IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT (PRIMARY)

Use when NO hero image is uploaded.

⸻

Hero Prompt (Universal / Multi-Industry)

Create a high-resolution, modern hero image for a professional website.

Industry: {industry or inferred from business name + description}
Business name: {business_name}
Description: {description}

The image should convey trust, professionalism, and clarity.  
Visual style: cinematic, clean, minimalistic, natural lighting, soft gradients, high contrast, shallow depth of field.  
Color palette: modern muted tones (blues, teals, indigos, grays).  
Composition: wide background scenery or abstract architectural/lifestyle scene with plenty of empty space for hero text overlay.  

Do NOT include any text, watermarks, logos, or words in the image.

Aspect ratio: 21:9  
Format: Web-safe, no borders, no frames.

What this generates:
A modern hero header similar to premium SaaS sites, real estate sites, agency websites, or professional services landing pages.

It avoids the “AI awkwardness” of trying to recreate literal product images.

2. HERO IMAGE (INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC VARIANTS)

Use these when the business description clearly signals a category.

⸻

Real Estate / Property Management

Cinematic wide hero image of modern residential or commercial buildings, soft evening lighting, clean architectural lines, minimalistic style, natural colors, spacious composition with large empty space for overlay text.  
No people, no text.

Home Services (HVAC, Plumbing, Cleaning, etc.)

Modern wide hero image showing clean tools, organized workspace, or well-lit home interior.  
Style: calm, premium, trustworthy, minimalistic.  
Avoid showing workers’ faces.  
Leave negative space for text overlay.

Medical / Therapy / Wellness

Soft, serene hero image of calming environment, modern interiors, soft natural light, muted blues, greens, and neutrals.  
Must feel professional and HIPAA-friendly.  
No people, no identifiable faces, no medical procedures.

E-commerce / Retail

Clean, premium flat-lay or lifestyle product scene based on the brand category.  
Warm lighting, soft shadows, ample whitespace for text overlay.

Technology / SaaS / AI

Abstract, clean, cinematic technology-themed background using minimal shapes, soft gradients, neural network-like elements, or futuristic textures.  
Muted palette (blue, indigo, gray).  
Leave large empty space for hero text.


⸻

3. SECONDARY SECTION IMAGE PROMPTS

These are used for “About,” “Services,” and supporting blocks.

⸻

A) About Section Background

Generate a clean, modern background image suitable for an About Us section on a professional business website.  
Theme and visual elements should loosely match the industry {industry}.  
Use soft lighting, subtle textures, and minimalistic design.  
No text, no people, no faces.  
Aspect ratio: 16:9.


⸻

B) Services / What We Do Section

Generate a modern, abstract or semi-literal image that visually represents the services of a business in the {industry}.  
Style: clean, minimalistic, high-quality, soft gradients or subtle illustrations.  
No text, no icons, no infographics.


⸻

C) Call-To-Action Section (CTA Banner)

Create a bold, modern, high-contrast background image designed to sit behind a call-to-action banner.  
Use deep tones (navy, charcoal, black-blue gradients) with subtle lighting or abstract texture.  
Minimalistic. No text.


⸻

D) Testimonials Section

Generate a soft, neutral background that enhances text readability.  
Use very light textures or abstract shapes.  
Style: premium, understated, minimal.  
Aspect ratio: 16:9.


⸻

4. AI IMAGE STYLE CONSISTENCY PROMPT (GLOBAL STYLE SETTING)

Use this when generating multiple images for the same site to maintain visual consistency.

Match the visual style, color palette, and mood of the previously generated hero image.  
Use the same lighting style, tonal range, and aesthetic.  
Maintain a cohesive design system across all images.

Call this automatically after generating the hero — pass the hero metadata into this prompt.

⸻

5. FALLBACK PROMPT IF INDUSTRY IS UNKNOWN

If Arclo cannot infer the industry:

Create a clean, modern, abstract hero background image suitable for a professional business website.  
Use a subtle gradient, soft lighting, geometric or organic shapes, and a muted cool-toned color palette.  
Make the design feel premium and trustworthy.  
21:9 aspect ratio.  
No text or symbols.

This prevents ugly stock-looking AI output.

6. DEVELOPER IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Your developer must:
	•	Always attempt business-specific prompts first
	•	Fallback to abstract if description is vague
	•	Always request 21:9 for hero, 16:9 for others
	•	Apply compression + WebP
	•	Preload the hero image
	•	Lazy load the rest

⸻

If you want, I can now do:

A) The exact Tailwind/CSS color generation logic

B) The wireframe layout (desktop + mobile)

C) The unified prompt library for generating copy (H1, tagline, services list, etc.)
