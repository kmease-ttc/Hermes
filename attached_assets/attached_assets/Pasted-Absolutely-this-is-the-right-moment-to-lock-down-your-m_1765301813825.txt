Absolutely — **this is the right moment** to lock down your *marketing site foundation* before you begin account creation, auth flows, dashboards, payments, onboarding, etc.

Below is **Phase 1: Full Marketing-Site Audit + Developer Task List**
This ensures every page is present, clean, consistent with the design system, and ready for customer sign-ups.

This is written **directly for your developer**, broken into:

---

# ✅ **Part 1 — Missing Pages (must add before product launch)**

### **1. Privacy Policy (REQUIRED for all SaaS)**

Route: `/privacy`
Needs:

* Full GDPR/CCPA compliance text
* Your company name (Arclo, Inc.), address, contact email
* Data usage (basic outline is fine for now)
* Cookie policy line

### **2. Terms of Service (REQUIRED)**

Route: `/terms`
Needs:

* Liability sections
* Acceptable use
* Subscription terms
* Cancellation/refund rules
* AI-generated content disclaimer

### **3. Contact Page (Strongly Recommended)**

Route: `/contact`
Should include:

* Simple form (Name, Email, Message)
* Email: `support@arclo.pro`
* Optional Calendly embed

### **4. FAQ Page**

Route: `/faq`
Sections:

* Pricing
* What’s automated?
* How does SEO improve daily?
* How many pages do I get?
* Can I migrate from Wix/WordPress?
* Does it support custom domains?
* Does AI write content?

### **5. 404 Page**

Route: `/404`

* Should match design system
* Clear CTA: “Back to Home”

---

# ✅ **Part 2 — Existing Pages: What Needs Fixing / Improving**

Below is a page-by-page audit.

---

# 🔧 **1. Home Page — Status: 90% done**

Needs:

* Final polish on spacing hierarchy (consistent section gaps).
* Improve the hero image alignment slightly (mockup sits a bit low).
* Add subtle transitions between sections (fade → fade).
* Ensure CTA buttons use shared components across site.
* Add trust anchors (e.g., “Built by a founder with 15+ years in enterprise software,” links to About Page).
* Confirm mobile layout for hero tags (avoid overlap).

---

# 🔧 **2. What We Do Page — Status: 75% done**

You've built the new **cluster map** + **vertical journey**, which is awesome.
Remaining:

### Must fix:

* Align vertical timeline dots to the card edges (currently visually off by 2–4px).
* Ensure each letter badge (A–F) uses same size, radii, spacing.
* Add mini module icons for visual clarity (Website = browser icon, SEO = spark, Keywords = search bubble).
* Add hover states for “Learn More” (icon shift, color change).
* Add top summary grid (already spec’d earlier).

### Strong recommendation:

* On mobile, timeline should collapse into **stacked cards with no vertical line**.

---

# 🔧 **3. About Page — Status: ~60%**

Problems we must fix:

### **Hero layout**

* Photo and headline alignment is slightly off-center (too much whitespace on left).
* “Connect on LinkedIn” button needs consistent styling.

### **Why Arclo Exists**

* This section looks OK but needs:

  * larger spacing
  * consistent typography (use SectionTitle and SectionSubtitle components)
  * add a subtle glow behind the quote line

### **Career Journey UI (visually broken)**

* Cards are too spaced out
* Timeline line is misaligned
* Dot on timeline is too saturated (purple vs brand indigo/blue)
* Card radii not consistent with design system
* Needs a soft glow behind cards
* Should stack cleanly on mobile (right now horizontal scrolling feels awkward)

**Fix:** Use the same pattern as the cluster map → centered layout → clean spacing → vertical timeline on mobile.

### **Missing section: Founder Values / Principles**

All great SaaS founders include a short values section:

* “Automation First”
* “Speed Over Complexity”
* “Local Businesses Deserve Better Tools”
* “Enterprise-Grade AI for Real People”

This builds trust.

---

# 🔧 **4. Examples Page — Status: 90%**

Needs:

* Add hover overlay CTA for each example (“View Site ↗”).
* Ensure category badges follow Pill component rules.
* Add a short intro above grid:

  * “See real sites built by Arclo — fully automated, SEO-optimized, and updated daily.”

Optional:

* Add pagination if you add more examples later.

---

# 🔧 **5. Pricing Page — Status: 85%**

Clean it up:

* Update pricing to recommended values (Starter $99, Pro $249, Agency $149/site).
* Add an Annual billing toggle (“Save 2 months”—works great for conversion).
* Add comparison table (Starter vs Pro vs Agency).
* Highlight most popular tier more prominently (Pro card glow ring).
* Ensure pricing cards use same glass + radii styling as features section.

---

# 🔧 **6. Roadmap Page — Status: ~90%**

You fixed the glow alignment — looks much better.

Remaining:

* Make pill icons consistent (size & weight).
* Add small top fade to blend into background better.
* Increase spacing above/below section title.
* Consider adding “ETA” labels (optional).

---

# 🔧 **7. Footer (global) — Status: 90%**

Needs:

* Ensure hover states match all site buttons/links.
* Add privacy + terms (once created).
* Add “© 2024 Arclo Inc.”
* Possibly add small tagline:

  * *The AI Website Engine*
* Check mobile stacking.

---

# ✅ **Part 3 — Pages Your Developer Should Build NOW (Phase 1)**

Here is the definitive list:

### **REQUIRED (pre-launch)**

* [ ] `/privacy`
* [ ] `/terms`
* [ ] `/contact`
* [ ] `/faq`
* [ ] `/404`

### **EXISTING PAGES: polish + fixes**

* [ ] Home → spacing, tags mobile behavior, trust anchors
* [ ] What We Do → summary grid + timeline alignment + icons
* [ ] About → restructure sections, fix timeline, fix hero layout
* [ ] Examples → improve overlays + typography + intro
* [ ] Pricing → new price points + annual toggle + comparison table
* [ ] Roadmap → icon consistency + spacing refinements

### **OPTIONAL (but recommended)**

* [ ] `/blog` → even before posts, create a placeholder page
* [ ] `/status` → uptime status placeholder (boosts professionalism)
* [ ] `/legal/acceptable-use` → sometimes required for AI tools

---

# 🎯 **Part 4 — Developer Deliverables (Clear Checklist)**

Give this directly to your developer:

### **Global**

* [ ] All pages wrapped in `AppLayout`
