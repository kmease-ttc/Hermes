You’re right on both points:
	•	The timeout window should be shorter (so it fails fast and feels controlled).
	•	“Try again” must do something visible immediately, otherwise trust tanks.

Below are agent/dev instructions to fix this flow so it feels reliable and converts, even when the backend is flaky.

⸻

1) Shorten the timeout windows

Goal

Fail fast, then offer a recovery path that actually works.

Recommended timings
	•	UI “taking longer than expected” warning: at 30–45 seconds
	•	Hard timeout / show recovery screen: at 60–75 seconds
	•	Max total before forced terminal state: 90 seconds

Why: if it takes 2+ minutes, users assume it’s broken (and they’re usually right).

Developer requirements
	•	Separate timeouts by phase (don’t wait full duration for images):
	•	Content generation: 30–45s
	•	Image/logo generation: 30–45s (can continue in background)
	•	Deploy: 30–45s

If content is done but images aren’t: proceed with preview using placeholders and update images later.

⸻

2) Make “Try Again” actually work (and feel like it works)

Right now it’s either not wired, or the state machine prevents the click from triggering anything meaningful.

Required behavior for “Try Again”

When user clicks Try Again:
	1.	Immediately show an in-button spinner and change button label to:
	•	“Retrying…”
	2.	Fire a real action (one of these two is acceptable, choose one and stick to it):

Option A (preferred): Resume the same job
	•	Call an endpoint like: “resume job / recheck status”
	•	If the backend job is still running, show:
	•	“Still working…”
	•	and continue polling for another short window (15–30s)
	•	If the backend job died, restart only the failed steps.

Option B: Start a new job, but keep the same project
	•	Create a new job run tied to the same lead/site record
	•	Preserve inputs already collected (business name, industry, uploads)
	•	Show a new progress UI immediately

	3.	If retry fails again:

	•	Offer “Email me when it’s ready” (see below)
	•	Offer “Start Fresh” as secondary

QA acceptance criteria
	•	Clicking Try Again always triggers:
	•	visible UI change (spinner + status text)
	•	a network call
	•	a clear next state within 1–2 seconds

If the UI does nothing within 1–2 seconds, it is broken.

⸻

3) Add a trust-preserving recovery path (so “Start Fresh” doesn’t feel sketchy)

Your instinct is dead-on: if “Start Fresh” is the only working button, people lose trust.

Fix: explain why + preserve their work

On the timeout screen, add a short explanation:
	•	“Sometimes image generation can be slow. Your info is saved — you won’t lose anything.”

Then offer 3 choices (in this order):
	1.	Retry (primary)
	2.	Email me when it’s ready (secondary, very important)
	3.	Start Fresh (tertiary)

“Email me when it’s ready”

This is huge for trust and conversion.

Behavior:
	•	If the job completes later, email them the preview link.
	•	If job failed, email them a “We hit a snag—click to retry” link.

Even if they bounce, you get them back.

⸻

4) Reduce the chance of timeouts by changing what blocks completion

Right now you’re likely blocking the “preview ready” state on hero+logo generation.

That’s brittle.

New rule
	•	Preview becomes ready as soon as:
	•	content is generated
	•	site config saved
	•	preview deploy is available
	•	Images/logos can:
	•	continue in background
	•	update the preview when ready

This makes the system feel fast and reliable.

⸻

5) Prompt for your agent to implement all of this (copy/paste)

Use this verbatim:

PROMPT: Fix Timeout UX + Make Retry Work

We have a timeout screen that appears when site generation takes too long. It currently times out too late, and the “Try Again” button does nothing. “Start Fresh” works but hurts trust.

Implement the following changes:
	1.	Shorten timeout windows:

	•	Show “taking longer than expected” at 30–45 seconds.
	•	Show the timeout recovery screen at 60–75 seconds.
	•	Ensure the job always ends in a terminal state by 90 seconds.

	2.	Fix “Try Again” so it always performs a real action and shows immediate feedback:

	•	On click, show loading state (spinner + “Retrying…”).
	•	Trigger a real retry action:
	•	either resume the same job and poll status for 15–30s,
	•	or start a new job run tied to the same site/lead record while preserving inputs.
	•	If retry succeeds, route user back into the normal progress screen.
	•	If retry fails again, show a clear message and offer Email/Start Fresh options.

	3.	Add an “Email me when it’s ready” option on the timeout screen:

	•	If the job completes later, email the preview link.
	•	If it fails, email a retry link.
	•	Make this the recommended secondary option.

	4.	Update completion logic to avoid blocking on images/logos:

	•	The preview should be considered “ready” once content + config + deploy are complete.
	•	Hero/logo generation can continue in the background and update the site when done.
	•	This reduces timeouts and improves user trust.

	5.	Add a short trust message on timeout screen:

	•	“Your info is saved. Sometimes image generation takes longer. You won’t lose anything.”

	6.	Validate the flow end-to-end:

	•	Clicking Try Again always changes UI immediately and triggers a network call.
	•	Timeouts happen within the new shorter windows.
	•	Users can recover without losing progress.

Deliver:
	•	A brief summary of what was broken and how you fixed it.
	•	Confirmation of the new timeout thresholds and retry behavior.

If you want, I can also rewrite the exact timeout-screen copy so it feels calm and trustworthy (and doesn’t imply your system is broken).
