Here’s a clean spec you can hand straight to your Replit agent / dev.
No code, just behavior and rules.

⸻

1. Overall Goal

For every generated preview site:
	1.	There is always:
	•	A hero image (not just a flat gradient).
	•	A logo in the navbar.
	2.	If an address is provided, there is a visible map section.
	3.	The site includes the main services they offer (pulled from their existing site if provided).
	4.	The color palette is modern and readable (not super dark, not neon).
	5.	The preview is not marked “Preview Ready” until all of the above are in place.

Preview quality bar:
Someone seeing it for the first time should reasonably think:
“Whoa, this already looks like a finished site. Just ship this and I’ll fill in details later.”

2. Inputs the agent must look for

When the user starts a project, the agent should collect and normalize:
	•	Business name
	•	Business type / industry (if you infer it, store it)
	•	City + state (or full address if provided)
	•	Phone number
	•	Existing website URL (optional)
	•	Short description (optional – but can be AI generated)

If the user gives an existing website URL, treat it as a primary content source.

3. Color Palette Rules

Do NOT generate arbitrary colors each time. Use a fixed library of “safe” palettes.
	1.	Create ~10 named palettes that are modern and widely used on the web:
	•	Examples:
	•	Indigo / soft blue SaaS palette
	•	Teal / cyan + slate
	•	Navy + electric blue accent
	•	Charcoal + violet accent
	•	Forest green + sand neutrals
	•	Dark blue + aqua accent
	•	Warm gray + cobalt
	•	Deep plum + lavender
	•	Black/charcoal + lime muted accent
	•	Warm beige + dark slate
	2.	Each palette should define:
	•	Primary color (for primary buttons and key highlights)
	•	Secondary color (for secondary buttons / badges)
	•	Background gradient (hero)
	•	Neutral backgrounds (light and mid)
	•	Text color (almost-black for light backgrounds, off-white for dark)
	3.	Palette selection rules:
	•	If you can infer industry, pick a palette that fits:
	•	Trades / home services: indigo/blue, teal/blue, or navy/aqua.
	•	Healthcare / wellness: teal/green + soft neutrals.
	•	Tech / SaaS: indigo + violet, navy + electric blue, or charcoal + cyan.
	•	If no clear industry, fall back to a default SaaS-style indigo/blue palette.
	4.	Lightness rule:
	•	Hero must NOT be near-black. Keep the main hero background at a medium-dark level with enough contrast for white text but not pure #000.
	•	Body sections below the hero should alternate between white and very light neutral backgrounds.

4. Logo Requirements

The preview is not allowed to be “ready” without a logo.
	1.	First, try to extract an existing logo if a website URL is provided:
	•	Look for common logo selectors (header img, .logo, etc.).
	•	If found and it’s not huge, use that image in the navbar.
	2.	If no logo can be extracted, generate a simple wordmark logo:
	•	Use the business name (or main word from it) as the logo text.
	•	Choose a font that matches the palette (clean sans-serif).
	•	Use the primary color as the accent (either text color or an underline / simple mark).
	•	Include a very simple mark if possible (circle, droplet, wrench icon, house outline, spark, etc. depending on industry).
	•	This can be image-based or pure CSS, but visually it must look like a deliberate logo, not just default text.
	3.	Also generate a favicon:
	•	Use the first letter or two letters of the business name in a square using the primary color.
	4.	The agent must check:
	•	If neither an extracted logo nor a generated logo is present, do NOT mark the preview as “ready.” Retry generation once. Otherwise, fall back to a clean text logo with bold font + primary color.

⸻

5. Hero Image Requirements

The hero can never be just a flat gradient. It must have a hero image or rich visual.
	1.	For every site, the agent must ensure:
	•	There is a hero background image (photo or high-quality abstract).
	•	The image supports the industry or at least looks modern and professional.
	2.	Image generation process:
	•	Start hero image generation in parallel with text generation and logo generation.
	•	Use the business name, industry, and city to prompt the model (e.g., “modern plumbing in Austin, TX” style visuals).
	•	Make sure the prompt calls for:
	•	Wide, cinematic composition.
	•	Plenty of empty space for text overlay.
	•	No text or words in the image.
	•	Modern, minimal, not cheesy stock-photo style if possible.
	3.	Fallbacks:
	•	If the hero image generation fails or returns empty:
	•	Retry once with a simpler, abstract prompt tied to the chosen palette (e.g., soft gradient with subtle shapes).
	•	Only if both attempts fail, use a pre-baked abstract hero image from your palette library—never leave it as a plain, single-color background.
	4.	The agent must explicitly check:
	•	“Is there a valid hero image URL or asset assigned to the hero section?”
	•	If not, the preview is NOT allowed to be considered done; run generation again or choose a default.

6. Call-To-Action Buttons (including Call Now)

The buttons need to look intentional and readable, especially “Call Now”.
	1.	Primary CTA (“Get a Free Quote”, etc.):
	•	Use the primary palette color as the background.
	•	White text.
	•	Full-width or prominent, with enough padding so it feels “touchable.”
	2.	Secondary CTA (“Call Now”):
	•	Either:
	•	Outline button with primary color border and neutral background, OR
	•	Solid button with a softer secondary color.
	•	Include the phone icon consistently (same position, same size).
	•	Ensure text contrast is high (no light gray on light background, etc.).
	3.	Layout rule:
	•	Buttons should sit on a single line on desktop when there’s room, and stack nicely on mobile.
	•	There must be enough vertical spacing between headline, body text, and CTAs to make it feel like a hero section, not a cramped block.
	4.	Validation step:
	•	Check that the “Call Now” button is present and has a phone number available.
	•	If there’s no phone number, change the label to a different secondary action (e.g., “Contact Us”) rather than showing a broken “Call Now.”

7. Map Section (When Address Is Provided)

If the user gives an address (or at least city + state):
	1.	Add a “Find Us” or “Service Area” section below the hero or near the contact section.
	2.	The section should include:
	•	Business name
	•	Address
	•	Service area text (e.g., “Serving Austin, TX and nearby communities.”)
	•	A map component (either an embedded map or a static map image) centered on that address or city.
	3.	If geocoding fails, still show the address and “Service area” text, but hide the map tile rather than showing a broken map.

8. Services and Content from Existing Website

When a website URL is provided, use it as a seed to make the preview feel specific and real.
	1.	Crawl at least:
	•	The homepage
	•	Obvious “Services” or “What We Do” pages
	•	“About” page
	2.	Extract:
	•	List of service names
	•	Short service descriptions if available
	•	Any key differentiators (e.g., “24/7 emergency service,” “licensed and insured,” “locally owned,” etc.)
	3.	Use these in the generated site:
	•	Services section: show at least 3–6 concrete services.
	•	Bullet badges under the hero (e.g., “Licensed & Insured,” “Same-Day Service,” “Locally Owned”).
	•	About section: convert the existing story into a more concise AI-rewritten version.
	4.	If no website is provided, the agent should:
	•	Use the business type + city to generate a sensible default set of services for that industry and market.

9. Concurrency and Speed

You’re okay slowing things down a little if it improves quality, but do as much as possible in parallel.
	1.	When a new site generation starts, the agent should fire off in parallel:
	•	Text/content generation (headlines, descriptions, services, about, etc.).
	•	Color palette selection (very fast).
	•	Logo extraction or generation.
	•	Hero image generation.
	•	Map lookup (if address is present).
	2.	The agent can assemble the page structure immediately with placeholders, but:
	•	Do not serve or mark the preview as “ready” until hero image and logo assets are resolved (or a fallback is chosen).
	•	Use a simple progress indicator if necessary:
	•	“Designing your layout”
	•	“Generating your logo and hero image”
	•	“Adding service and location details”
	3.	The maximum acceptable delay to keep it feeling fast:
	•	Aim for 10–20 seconds total.
	•	If images take too long, use a lower-res first pass and replace them in the background once the high-res version is ready (but hero should never appear completely blank).

10. Preview Readiness Checklist

Before the system labels anything “Preview Ready”, the agent must confirm ALL of this:
	1.	Site has:
	•	Business name in navbar and hero
	•	City/state (if provided) shown near hero or in a subtitle
	2.	Visuals:
	•	Logo present (extracted, generated, or text logo with deliberate styling)
	•	Hero image assigned and visible (real or abstract, but not a flat color)
	•	Palette from the approved set applied (no raw random colors)
	3.	Content:
	•	Clear headline and subheadline in hero
	•	At least 3 service items (real or reasonable defaults)
	•	Short About section
	•	Contact method (phone or form)
	4.	Extras:
	•	Map section present if address exists
	•	“Call Now” button styled correctly if phone is available
	•	No obviously broken placeholders like “Lorem ipsum” or empty sections

If any of these fail, the agent should:
	•	Try to regenerate the missing elements once.
	•	If still failing, fall back to safe defaults (pre-made hero image, text logo) and only then mark it ready.

If you want, next I can write the exact natural-language prompts your Max/Opus agent should use for:
	•	Hero image generation
	•	Logo generation / refinement
	•	Service extraction / generation from an existing site
	•	Map + service area copy

all phrased in a way that plays nicely with Replit’s “agent as developer” setup.
