Absolutely — here is a **clean, precise, developer-ready upgrade plan** to make the entire **“Coming Soon / Roadmap”** section *way cooler*, more premium, more consistent with your dark AI aesthetic, and without revealing backend vendors like “Alkay.”

I’ll also give **specific Tailwind snippets**, layout improvements, and visual styling upgrades.

---

# ✅ **WHAT TO FIX / IMPROVE**

From your screenshot, the current section has these issues:

* Looks **too plain** compared to the rest of your premium design.
* Tag pills are floating awkwardly and feel disconnected.
* The spacing makes it feel empty.
* Background is flat and needs subtle gradients/light blobs.
* The “ROADMAP” tag should feel more like an AI system label.
* “(Alkay)” must be removed — you don’t show internal tools publicly.
* No interaction / hover / depth.
* No visual boundary between roadmap and footer.

We’ll fix all of that.

# 🎨 **NEW DESIGN SPEC — ROADMAP SECTION (Premium AI Style)**

## 1. **Background Upgrade**

Use a soft gradient that fades into the dark footer:

```
bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-50 via-slate-100 to-[#181857]
```

Optional: Add subtle top lighting:

```
<div class="absolute inset-x-0 top-0 h-40 bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top,_rgba(79,70,229,0.15),_transparent_70%)] opacity-60"></div>
```

This pulls the design upward visually and gives a “system panel” feel.

---

## 2. **Roadmap Tag (Make it look like a system label)**

Turn the “ROADMAP” text into a glowing micro-tag, similar to your dark section micro tag.

```
<p class="text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-indigo-600 bg-indigo-50/60 rounded-full px-3 py-1 inline-block shadow-sm">
  ROADMAP
</p>
```

---

## 3. **Title Styling**

Make it match your hero typography:

```
<h2 class="mt-4 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold text-slate-900">
  Coming Soon to Arclo
</h2>
```

Optional supporting sentence:

```
<p class="mt-3 text-slate-600 max-w-xl mx-auto">
  Powerful new features that will expand your automated marketing capabilities — all built into Arclo.
</p>
```

This ties it to your overall narrative of AI automation.

---

## 4. **Feature Pills — Make Them Look Like AI Chips**

Your current pills are basic. They can look like premium glass/gradient chips:

```
<div class="
  inline-flex items-center gap-2
  rounded-full px-5 py-2.5
  bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-xl
  border border-slate-200/60
  shadow-[0_4px_16px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]
  hover:shadow-[0_6px_22px_rgba(79,70,229,0.25)]
  hover:border-indigo-300 transition-all
  cursor-pointer
">
  Ads Automation
</div>
```

### Updated pill text list (cleaned, no backend vendor names):

* Ads Automation
* Social Media Automation
* Reputation Management
* Google Business Profile Automation

### Add a small AI spark icon on hover:

Use lucide `<Sparkles />` or `<Zap />` subtle icon animation:

```
group-hover:scale-110 transition
```

---

## 5. **Pill Layout Upgrade**

Switch from a flat horizontal row to a **responsive, center-aligned pill cloud**:

```
<div class="mt-10 flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4 md:gap-6">
  <!-- pill components -->
</div>
```

This feels more premium and dynamic, like a real roadmap.

---

## 6. **Add Soft Connection Lines (Optional but looks amazing)**

Between pills, you can add super faint curved lines to imply relationships:

```
opacity-[0.05] absolute hidden md:block
pointer-events-none
```

This mimics the look of AI nodes / systems.

---

## 7. **Improve Spacing + Hierarchy**

Here’s the exact spacing you should use:

```
pt-28 pb-36
space-y-6
```

Then add a smooth **transition gradient** into the footer so it looks intentional instead of boxed in.

---

# 🔥 **RESULT**

These upgrades will make the section:

* More visually connected to the premium dark footer
* More “AI system module” rather than a flat placeholder
* More modern and futuristic
* More trustworthy (removes backend vendor references)
* More engaging (hover, shadow, glow)

This will visually match your **hero**, **features**, **stats**, and **pricing** sections.

# ❓ Want Me to Generate the JSX for This Entire Section?

I can generate **a complete replacement React component for `/Home.tsx`** that matches your new style guide:

* background gradients
* glowing roadmap tag
* premium pills
* hover effects
* spacing
* container
* Tailwind classes ready to paste

Just say:

**“Generate the roadmap section JSX”**
