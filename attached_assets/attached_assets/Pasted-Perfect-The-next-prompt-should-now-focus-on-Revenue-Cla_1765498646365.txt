Perfect. The next prompt should now focus on Revenue Clarity & Conversion.

At this stage, Arclo is functionally strong. The remaining risk is confusion at the moment of purchase. Pricing, packaging, and add-ons must feel:
	•	obvious
	•	fair
	•	easy to say yes to
	•	easy to upgrade later

So the next workstream is:

👉 Pricing, Packaging, and Monetization UX

This is about turning interest into money without friction.

⸻

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Pricing, Packaging & Monetization

Agent Prompt

Objective

Redesign Arclo’s pricing and packaging system so that:
	•	users understand what they’re paying for
	•	the base plan feels like a no-brainer
	•	add-ons feel modular and valuable
	•	upgrades feel like “turning on outcomes,” not buying complexity
	•	pricing is consistent across marketing, checkout, and dashboard

This work should not change core functionality — only how it’s presented, bundled, and sold.

⸻

PART 1 — Define the Pricing Model (Required)

Base Plan (Mandatory)

Implement a single required base plan:

Starter Website Platform
Includes:
	•	Website hosting
	•	Ongoing site updates
	•	Core maintenance
	•	Basic performance monitoring
	•	Activity + reporting dashboard

Price target:
	•	~$99/month (configurable)

Rules:
	•	Exactly one base plan must be active per site
	•	No site can exist without a base plan after publish

⸻

PART 2 — Modular Add-Ons (Critical)

Add-Ons Are the Primary Upsell Mechanism

All advanced value must live in add-ons, not bundles.

Implement add-ons as independent services with:
	•	clear outcome-based names
	•	plain-language descriptions
	•	transparent pricing
	•	immediate activation

Examples:
	•	Weekly Website Improvements
	•	Blog Writing
	•	Location Page Expansion
	•	Technical SEO
	•	Google Visibility Monitoring
	•	Rank Tracking

Each add-on must:
	•	map to one or more background services
	•	surface activities in the dashboard
	•	appear in “Available Services” when inactive

⸻

PART 3 — Pricing Page Redesign (Marketing Site)

Requirements

Redesign the pricing page to show:
	1.	Base Plan (centered, emphasized)
	2.	Add-Ons (below, modular)
	3.	Example configurations (“Most customers choose…”)

Rules
	•	No jargon
	•	No feature grids
	•	No SEO terminology without explanation
	•	Focus on outcomes

Example:
“Show up on Google in more cities”
instead of
“Programmatic location pages”

⸻

PART 4 — Checkout Experience (Critical)

Checkout Must Match Pricing Page Exactly

Ensure:
	•	same names
	•	same prices
	•	same descriptions

Checkout flow:
	1.	Base plan (required)
	2.	Add-ons (checkboxes)
	3.	Domain (if applicable)
	4.	Setup assistance (optional)

Display:
	•	monthly total
	•	annual items clearly labeled
	•	no surprises

⸻

PART 5 — In-Product Upsell UX

Rules for Upsells

Upsells should appear:
	•	in “Available Services”
	•	in “What’s Next”
	•	contextually after milestones

Never:
	•	interrupt primary workflows
	•	block required actions
	•	use popups

Tone:
Helpful, optional, outcome-focused.

⸻

PART 6 — Service Comparison & Transparency

Add “What You’re Missing” View

When a user has:
	•	base plan only

Show a lightweight comparison:
	•	what’s active
	•	what’s available
	•	what outcomes they could unlock

No pressure language.

⸻

PART 7 — Pricing Governance (Internal)

Add config-driven pricing:
	•	prices editable without redeploy
	•	ability to:
	•	hide services
	•	change copy
	•	A/B pricing later

Include feature flags for:
	•	early-user discounts
	•	bundles
	•	promotions

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Pricing is simple and obvious
	•	Users understand what they’re buying
	•	Add-ons feel optional but valuable
	•	Checkout matches expectations
	•	Revenue opportunities are visible everywhere without being pushy

⸻

Why this is the right next step

You’ve already built:
	•	value
	•	trust
	•	guidance
	•	safety

Now you need to capture that value cleanly.

This work ensures Arclo feels:

“Worth it, easy to understand, and fair”

instead of:

“Powerful but confusing.”

⸻

After this, the next two workstreams would be:
	1.	Agency / multi-site mode
	2.	Growth loops (referrals, examples, SEO for Arclo itself)

When ready, I’ll write either prompt.
