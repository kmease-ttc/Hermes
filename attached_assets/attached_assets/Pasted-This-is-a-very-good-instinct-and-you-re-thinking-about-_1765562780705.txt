This is a very good instinct, and you’re thinking about it the right way.

Short answer first, then I’ll give you:
	1.	My take on the idea
	2.	How these value statements should be written (rules + examples)
	3.	Whether to do 2 vs 4 blogs/month
	4.	A single prompt you can give the agent to implement this cleanly on the pricing page

⸻

1. Is this a good idea? Yes — with one important constraint

Adding concise value statements under each add-on is the right move, as long as:
	•	They focus on outcomes (traffic, leads, visibility)
	•	They do not promise guarantees
	•	They feel like directional impact, not hard claims
	•	They don’t overwhelm the page or turn it into a spreadsheet

Right now, the add-ons answer:
“What does this do?”

What you want them to answer is:
“Why would I pay $49–$199/month for this?”

That’s exactly the right framing.

⸻

2. How the value statements SHOULD be written (rules)

These should not read like marketing fluff or SEO jargon.

Writing rules for each value statement
	•	1 short sentence (max 2 lines)
	•	Plain language
	•	No percentages that sound fake
	•	Directional impact, not guarantees
	•	Written from the business owner’s POV

Good phrasing patterns
	•	“Typically helps…”
	•	“Often leads to…”
	•	“Designed to increase…”
	•	“Commonly results in…”
	•	“Over time, this can…”

Avoid:
	•	“Guaranteed”
	•	“Exact % increases”
	•	“Rank #1”
	•	“Explode your traffic”

We want credible, calm confidence, not hype.

3. Blogs: 2 vs 4 per month (important)

You are correct that blogs are “cheap” for you — but there is a best-practice nuance.

Industry reality
	•	1 high-quality blog per week (≈4/month) is excellent
	•	It’s a very standard cadence for SEO growth
	•	Especially for local + service businesses

My recommendation
	•	Upgrade Blog Writing add-on to 4 posts/month
	•	Keep the price the same or modestly higher
	•	Position it as “weekly content” (people understand that)

Why this helps you:
	•	Stronger perceived value
	•	Easier mental model (“every week”)
	•	Faster compounding SEO impact
	•	Makes the add-on feel much more “alive”

So yes — I would absolutely move to 4 blogs/month.

⸻

4. Suggested value statements (examples for each add-on)

Below are example value statements you can use as a baseline.
These are written to feel credible and non-salesy.

Weekly Website Improvements ($149/mo)

Value statement:

Keeps your site fresh and improving, which helps Google trust it more and brings in more customers over time.

⸻

Blog Writing – 4 posts/month ($199/mo)

(Value updated from 2 → 4 posts)

Value statement:

Regular content gives your site more chances to show up in searches and helps attract customers looking for your services.

⸻

Location Page Expansion ($79/mo)

Value statement:

Helps you appear in searches across more cities and service areas, bringing in customers you wouldn’t reach otherwise.

⸻

Technical SEO ($99/mo)

Value statement:

⸻

Google Visibility Monitoring ($49/mo)

Value statement:

⸻

Rank Tracking ($39/mo)

⸻

Lead Tracking ($X/mo)

These statements do exactly what you’re aiming for:
	•	They explain why it matters
	•	They connect directly to traffic or leads
	•	They don’t require SEO knowledge
	•	They feel honest

⸻

5. Prompt to give the agent (copy/paste)

Here’s a single prompt you can hand to your agent to implement this cleanly.

⸻

PROMPT: Add Outcome-Based Value Statements to Pricing Add-Ons

You are updating the add-on section on the Arclo pricing page.

Goals
	•	Help non-technical business owners understand why each add-on is worth the price.
	•	Focus on outcomes like traffic, leads, visibility, and customers.
	•	Do not add SEO jargon or guarantees.
	•	Keep the page clean and easy to scan.

Instructions
	1.	Under each add-on card, add a short value statement (1 sentence, max 2 lines) that explains the business impact.
	2.	Write in plain language for local business owners (plumbers, HVAC, bakeries, med spas).
	3.	Use directional phrasing (e.g., “helps”, “designed to”, “often leads to”).
	4.	Do not use percentages, rankings, or promises.
	5.	Do not use technical SEO terms unless already present and unavoidable.

Specific changes
	•	Update Blog Writing to 4 posts per month.
	•	Frame it as “weekly content” rather than “SEO blogging”.

Example tone (do not copy verbatim)

“This helps your site show up in more searches and brings in customers over time.”

Validation checklist

Before finishing, confirm:
	•	Every add-on has a value statement.
	•	No add-on reads like marketing fluff.
	•	A non-technical business owner can understand the benefit immediately.
	•	The pricing page still feels simple and uncluttered.

⸻

6. My overall take

You’re doing the right thing by:
	•	Keeping the pricing modular
	•	Avoiding SEO jargon
	•	Making value explicit
	•	Letting people self-select add-ons

These value statements will increase attach rate on add-ons without hurting trust.

Once this is in, going back to Steps 2–4 will be much easier because:
	•	Your blog system will be clearer
	•	Your keyword strategy will already be implicitly priced in
	•	Your growth narrative will be consistent across product and content

When you’re ready, we can go straight back to Step 2 (keyword map) next.
