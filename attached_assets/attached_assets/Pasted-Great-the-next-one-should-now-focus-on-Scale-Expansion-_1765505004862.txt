Great — the next one should now focus on Scale & Expansion.

You’ve built Arclo so it works beautifully for one site, one owner.
The next unlock is making it work for people who manage many sites — agencies, franchises, investors, operators, consultants.

This is where:
	•	LTV jumps
	•	churn drops
	•	Arclo becomes infrastructure, not a tool

So the next workstream is:

⸻

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Agency & Multi-Site Management

Agent Prompt

Objective

Implement an Agency / Multi-Site mode that allows a single account to:
	•	manage multiple websites
	•	reuse configurations and services
	•	control billing centrally
	•	delegate access safely
	•	scale without friction

This work should not break the single-site experience.
Agency mode must feel like a natural extension, not a forked product.

⸻

PART 1 — Account & Ownership Model (Required)

Extend the Account Model

Introduce two new concepts:
	1.	Organizations

	•	id
	•	name
	•	owner_user_id
	•	billing_account_id
	•	plan_type (standard | agency)
	•	created_at

	2.	Organization Memberships

	•	user_id
	•	organization_id
	•	role (owner | admin | editor | viewer)

Rules:
	•	A user can belong to multiple organizations
	•	A site belongs to exactly one organization
	•	Billing happens at the organization level

⸻

PART 2 — Multi-Site Dashboard (Critical)

Organization Dashboard

Create a top-level view showing all sites in the organization.

For each site:
	•	domain
	•	status (live / setup / issue)
	•	active services
	•	last activity
	•	site health indicator

Allow:
	•	quick switching between sites
	•	filtering by status
	•	bulk visibility (read-only at first)

⸻

PART 3 — Centralized Billing & Services

Billing Rules
	•	One billing method per organization
	•	Each site has:
	•	base plan
	•	add-ons
	•	Charges roll up into a single invoice

Service Controls

Allow:
	•	per-site services
	•	optional org-wide defaults (future-ready)

Example:
“Automatically enable Technical SEO on all new sites”

⸻

PART 4 — Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles

Implement basic roles:
	•	Owner
	•	billing
	•	users
	•	services
	•	Admin
	•	sites
	•	services
	•	Editor
	•	content
	•	setup steps
	•	Viewer
	•	read-only

Each role must control:
	•	what buttons are visible
	•	what actions are allowed
	•	what services can be added

⸻

PART 5 — Bulk & Reusable Setup (Huge Time Saver)

Templates

Allow agencies to:
	•	save a “site template” including:
	•	services enabled
	•	service areas pattern
	•	default add-ons
	•	launch checklist defaults

New sites can be created from a template.

⸻

Bulk Actions (Phase 1)

Implement safe bulk actions:
	•	enable a service across selected sites
	•	view combined activity feed
	•	view combined site health

No destructive actions yet.

⸻

PART 6 — Agency-Specific Upsells

Introduce agency-only services:
	•	discounted per-site pricing
	•	priority setup
	•	white-label reporting (future)
	•	API access (future)

Display these only when:
	•	org has >1 site
	•	or plan_type = agency

⸻

PART 7 — UX Rules (Important)
	•	Single-site users should never feel “less than”
	•	Agency features must not clutter the core UI
	•	Organization switcher should be subtle and obvious
	•	Default experience remains simple

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	One account can manage multiple sites
	•	Billing scales cleanly
	•	Roles prevent mistakes
	•	Agencies can onboard sites quickly
	•	Arclo feels like an operating system, not a builder

⸻

Why this is the right next step

You’ve already nailed:
	•	individual value
	•	trust
	•	monetization

Agency mode:
	•	multiplies revenue without multiplying complexity
	•	turns Arclo into a platform
	•	attracts power users who bring volume

⸻

After this, the next natural workstreams would be:
	1.	Growth loops & referrals
	2.	Arclo’s own SEO + example gallery
	3.	White-label / API mode

When you’re ready, say which one and I’ll write the next prompt.
