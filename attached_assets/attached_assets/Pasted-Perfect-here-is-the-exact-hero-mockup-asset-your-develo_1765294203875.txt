Perfect — here is the **exact hero mockup asset** your developer can drop into the hero section.
This is formatted as a clean, ready-to-implement specification for them to build the visual in code **OR** for your designer to export as a PNG/SVG.

Since I cannot embed an actual image file directly into the codebase without you uploading one, I will generate a **pixel-perfect, developer-ready asset spec** that your team can recreate *exactly* in Figma or React.

# ✅ **Arclo Hero Mockup Asset — Developer Implementation Spec**

This defines **the visual itself**, not the whole section layout.
It’s a standalone graphic that developers can insert as `/src/assets/hero-mockup.png` or as a JSX component.

---

# **🎨 1. Canvas**

* **Width:** 1200px
* **Height:** 800px
* **Background:** Transparent (PNG)
* **Padding:** 0

The graphic should layer perfectly on a white hero background.

---

# **🖥️ 2. Main Website Mockup (Centerpiece)**

### Container

* **Width:** 860px
* **Height:** 520px
* **Corner Radius:** 24px
* **Shadow:**

  ```
  0px 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)
  ```
* **Background:** White (#FFFFFF)

### Inside the mockup

Use a **beautiful, generic website layout** so users think:

“Damn… Arclo could build me something this clean.”

Minimal but premium:

#### Header

* Logo placeholder left
* 3–4 nav items right (gray 500)
* Height: 72px

#### Hero block inside mockup

* Large headline placeholder: “Your Business. Done Right.”

  * Font: Manrope ExtraBold
  * Size: 36px
* Subheader text: 2 lines, gray-600
* CTA button inside mockup (rounded, dark gray)

#### Image placeholder

* Full-width curved placeholder block
* Light gray (#F3F4F6) with slight vignette

#### Feature row

* 3 simple icons + labels (gray 500)

This "fake" website should feel like:

* clean
* modern
* minimal
* highly professional

**Your mockup doesn’t need to be real content — it needs to *look* real and expensive.**

---

# **✨ 3. Automation Floating Labels (Around the mockup)**

These float *outside* the website mockup, giving the impression of AI working on it.

### Style (all labels)

* Font: Inter Medium 15px
* Background: White
* Text Color: #4F46E5
* Border Radius: 14px
* Padding: 10px 18px
* Shadow:

  ```
  0px 12px 24px rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.18)
  ```
* Gentle glow:

  ```
  0px 0px 18px rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.12)
  ```

### Labels & Positioning

#### **Top-left** (offset –120px horizontal, –40px vertical)

```
Content Written ✓
```

#### **Top-right** (offset +130px horizontal, –20px vertical)

```
SEO Fixed ✓
```

#### **Right-center** (offset +160px horizontal, +80px vertical)

```
Daily Improvements ✓
```

#### **Bottom-left** (offset –110px horizontal, +100px vertical)

```
Pages Generated ✓
```

These should feel **alive** — even if static, they must visually imply movement.

# **🔮 4. AI Glow Layer (Behind mockup)**

This adds the magic.

### Glow specs

* Shape: Radial gradient
* Size: 1100px × 600px
* Placement: Center behind website mockup
* Colors:

  * Center: `rgba(79, 70, 229, 0.18)` (Indigo)
  * Outer: `rgba(79, 70, 229, 0)`

### Blur:

* **220px** feathered blur

This creates a soft halo behind the mockup — subtle, premium, not neon.

---

# **📦 5. Export Requirements**

When the designer recreates this in Figma, they must export:

### `hero-mockup.png`

* 1x: 1200 × 800
* Transparent PNG
* Compression: none (lossless)
* Shadows included
* Glow included
* Floating labels included

This single asset gets dropped into:

```
/client/src/assets/hero/hero-mockup.png
```

Then inserted into the hero section as:

```jsx
<img 
  src="/assets/hero/hero-mockup.png" 
  alt="Arclo automated website mockup"
  className="w-full max-w-[900px] mx-auto mt-12"
>
```

---

# **🔥 WHAT THIS GIVES YOU**

* A **badass, premium hero visual**
* A design that communicates **quality** + **automation** instantly
* A huge leap in trust & perceived value
* A visual anchor that says:

  **“This is what your website will look like… and Arclo builds it automatically.”**

---

# Want me to generate the PNG mockup for you next?

I can:

* Create the entire hero mockup as an **actual image**,
* Export it as a transparent PNG,
* And you can upload it directly into Replit.

Just say **“generate it”** and I’ll produce the real asset.
