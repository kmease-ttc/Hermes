Perfect, let’s lock this down so you can just hand everything to your dev.

I’ll cover, in one place:

1. Exact pages to create
2. For each page: route, layout notes, and ready-to-use copy (or clear section outlines)

You can paste this straight into a dev ticket / Notion doc.

## 5. About Page – Structure Fix

You already have a strong start; we just need to tighten structure.

**Route:** `/about` (already exists)

**Sections (in order):**

1. **Founder Hero** (what you have, tweak alignment)
2. **Why Arclo Exists** (problem + insight)
3. **What We Believe** (3–4 principle cards)
4. **Career Journey** (fixed UI)
5. **How That Helps You** (short value tie-back + CTA)

**Hero tweaks:**

* Ensure image and text are vertically centered.
* Use same section width as homepage hero.
* Button: use shared primary/secondary button component.

**Why Arclo Exists:**

* Section title: `Why Arclo Exists`
* 2 short paragraphs (you already have the copy).
* Add 3 bullet points summarizing the problem:

  * Expensive agencies
  * Overcomplicated tools
  * Under-optimized websites

**What We Believe (principles):**

Example cards:

* “Automation First”
* “Enterprise Rigor, Small Business Focus”
* “Results Over Vanity Metrics”

**Career Journey fixes:**

* Convert to **horizontal scroll cards on mobile** and a narrower row on desktop.
* Use same card style as other tiles (rounded, glass, subtle glow).
* Ensure the timeline line is centered on card midpoints.
* Date format: `2019–2023`, `2024–Present`.

## 6. Module Landing Pages (A–F)

These don’t all need to be fully fleshed out today, but you should at least have **basic marketing content** on each route so “Learn more” links aren’t dead.

**Routes:**

* `/website-generation`
* `/keyword-intelligence`
* `/autonomous-seo`
* `/search-console`
* `/seo-wave`
* `/image-intelligence`

**Common structure for all:**

1. Hero (short, strong value prop)
2. “What this module does” (3–5 bullets or cards)
3. Visual explainer (screenshot or conceptual graphic)
4. Results or proof snippet (reuse stat section or testimonials later)
5. CTA: “Generate My Website” or “Talk to Us”

### Example: `/website-generation`

Hero:

* Title: `Your Entire Website, Built for You in Seconds.`
* Subtitle: `Arclo generates a modern, conversion-ready website with pages, structure, design, and SEO baked in automatically.`

Key bullets:

* Multi-page site built from your business name, niche, and location
* Clean layouts for home, services, about, and contact
* Local SEO structure: titles, H1s, URLs, internal links
* Conversion-focused CTAs and lead capture built in

CTA: `[Generate My Website]`

Repeat this pattern for each module, using the bullet lists we already drafted earlier in the conversation.

---

## 7. 404 Page

**Route:** `/404` (and fallback for any unknown route)

**Content:**

* Title: `Page not found`
* Subtitle: `The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist or has moved.`
* Buttons:

  * `Back to Home`
  * `View What Arclo Does`

Use same Section + Card layout as other pages.

---

## Short Developer Checklist (Phase 1)

Give them this:

* [ ] Implement `/privacy` with the structure above.
* [ ] Implement `/terms` with structure above.
* [ ] Implement `/contact` with form + right-side contact info.
* [ ] Implement `/faq` with grouped accordions.
* [ ] Implement `/404` page and route all unknown URLs to it.
* [ ] Update `/about` with the new section structure and fix Career Journey UI.
* [ ] Create skeleton landing pages for 6 modules with consistent hero + bullets + CTA.
* [ ] Ensure header/footer links include: Home, What We Do, Examples, Pricing, About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms.
* [ ] Verify mobile layout and consistent design tokens on all new pages.

If you’d like, next step I can **write out the exact hero + bullet copy for each of the 6 module pages** so your dev can just paste text in.
