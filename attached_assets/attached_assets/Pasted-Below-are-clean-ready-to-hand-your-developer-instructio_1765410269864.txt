Below are clean, ready-to-hand-your-developer instructions for fixing the preview <iframe> so:
	1.	The generated site always looks good.
	2.	The hero image is never awkwardly cropped.
	3.	The preview isn’t tall, empty, or mis-scaled.
	4.	It feels like a polished “mini browser” (exactly like Webflow / Framer preview cards).

This version avoids code; it’s pure developer-facing requirements, broken into steps so they know exactly what to do.

✅ ARCLO IFRAME PREVIEW FIX — DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS

1. Goal

The preview inside the “Preview Ready” page should display a scaled-down full desktop version of the generated website — never cropped, never distorted, and never floating in a big white box.

The preview must feel like a complete mini browser window, not a screenshot fragment.

⸻

2. Required UX Behavior

The preview area must:
	•	Show the entire hero section above the fold.
	•	Use a fixed virtual desktop size (e.g., 1440×900).
	•	Scale the entire site proportionally (e.g., 0.5–0.7 scale).
	•	Auto-center horizontally in the preview card.
	•	Avoid scrollbar cropping inside the preview frame.
	•	Not push huge whitespace below the container.

⸻

3. Architectural Rules

Your developer needs to implement a wrapper container around the iframe with these responsibilities:

A) The wrapper defines a “virtual viewport”

This viewport pretends the site is 1440×900, even if the preview card is only 700px wide.

B) The wrapper scales the iframe down

Use CSS transform: scale() so the website appears smaller — like a screenshot but still interactive and live.

C) The wrapper sets overflow: hidden

No cropping on top or bottom.
The site should be fully visible — scaled to fit.

D) The iframe stays full-size

The iframe itself remains 1440×900 — do NOT change its dimensions.
Only the wrapper scales it.

⸻

4. Exact Developer Steps

STEP 1 — Choose a virtual desktop size

Use:
	•	Width: 1440px
	•	Height: 900px

Why:
	•	Standard modern desktop viewport.
	•	Enough vertical space to display a full hero section.

⸻

STEP 2 — Select a scaling factor

Pick:
	•	0.55 (55% of the virtual size)

This produces:
	•	Scaled width ≈ 792px
	•	Scaled height ≈ 495px

This fits nicely inside your preview card layout.

⸻

STEP 3 — Apply scaling to the wrapper container

The preview wrapper should:

Must:
	•	Apply transform: scale(0.55)
	•	Use transform-origin: top left
	•	Have its wrapper width/height match the scaled dimensions EXACTLY

Why:

If the wrapper’s width/height don’t match the scaled values, you get cropping or excess whitespace.

⸻

STEP 4 — The iframe should NOT be cropped

Inside the wrapper:
	•	The iframe is full 1440×900 (unscaled)
	•	The wrapper scales the entire iframe down
	•	The wrapper hides overflow
	•	The result looks like a smooth, clean mini-browser preview

⸻

STEP 5 — Put a fake browser UI on top (optional but strong UX)

Add:
	•	A thin top bar
	•	3 circular “browser dots” (red, yellow, green)
	•	Business name label

This makes the preview feel deliberate and professional.

⸻

STEP 6 — Remove excess whitespace around the preview

The preview container must:
	•	Auto-size to wrapper height
	•	NOT enforce a fixed large height
	•	NOT center vertically
	•	NOT include padding below the preview frame that makes it look cut off

Developers must:
	•	Remove hardcoded min-height rules
	•	Remove layout margins that create the white gap
	•	Ensure the outer container height is driven by wrapper height
	•	Ensure the “Open Preview in New Tab” button sits directly under the frame

⸻

STEP 7 — Responsive rules

On tablets (<900px):
	•	scale(0.45)
	•	Wrapper width = 1440 * 0.45
	•	Wrapper height = 900 * 0.45

On mobile (<600px):
	•	scale(0.35)
	•	Wrapper width = 1440 * 0.35
	•	Wrapper height = 900 * 0.35

This ensures it always fits the viewport.

⸻

5. Required Acceptance Criteria (QA Checklist)

Before marking the fix complete, the preview must:

Layout
	•	Show the entire hero image fully visible, never cut off.
	•	Show the navbar + logo + CTAs clearly.
	•	Show no scrollbars unless interaction is intended.
	•	Show no white dead space below the browser frame.

Visual Feel
	•	Feels like a live miniature website, not a cropped frame.
	•	Scaling is smooth and consistent across all sites.
	•	The preview card looks intentional and professional.

Usability
	•	Buttons and links inside preview work normally.
	•	The preview loads fast and maintains proportions while loading.
	•	The “Open in New Tab” button opens the full, unscaled site.

6. Final Developer Summary (copy/paste to your team)

Implement a scaled iframe preview:
	1.	Set iframe viewport to 1440×900.
	2.	Wrap iframe in a container.
	3.	Apply transform: scale(0.55) to wrapper.
	4.	Use transform-origin: top left.
	5.	Set wrapper width/height to scaled 1440×900 dimensions.
	6.	Hide overflow.
	7.	Ensure outer preview container auto-sizes to wrapper height.
	8.	Remove whitespace below preview.
	9.	Add responsive scaling for smaller screens.
	10.	Optional: Add browser bar design for polished presentation.

End goal:

A perfect “mini browser” preview where the entire hero section is always visible, nothing is cropped, the site looks polished, and the preview card feels like a professional design showcase.
