Below is a **clean, complete spec** you can give your developer to fix EVERY issue you just identified:

* overlay too dark
* wrong image subjects
* harsh purple header color
* inconsistent color palette
* phone number visibility issues
* generic feel due to incorrect industry context
* poor AI image prompts
* poor AI copy prompts

This is the **fit + finish spec** required to reach “LuckyThunder-level” quality.

# ✅ SECTION 1 — **Color System Fix (3-Color Palettes Only)**

Every palette should include:

### **1. Primary** (buttons, highlights, hero CTAs, active nav)

### **2. Secondary** (accents, outlines, badges)

### **3. Neutral** (backgrounds, overlays, text tones)

**DO NOT** use theme primary as an overlay color.
**DO NOT** use neon or harsh colors anywhere in the UI.

### ✔ Final Palette Structure Example

**Palette: Navy / Sky / Slate**

* `primary: #475BE8` (Sky Indigo)
* `secondary: #0EA5E9` (Sky Blue)
* `neutral: #0F172A` (Slate 900)

**Palette: Teal / Emerald / Slate**

* `primary: #0F766E`
* `secondary: #10B981`
* `neutral: #1E293B`

**Palette: Plum / Pink / Slate (for beauty/therapy/med spa)**

* `primary: #7C3AED`
* `secondary: #EC4899`
* `neutral: #1E1B4B`

### Developer instructions:

1. Update `themes.ts` to enforce **exactly 3 colors** per palette.
2. Replace all places where gradients use theme colors.
3. Use theme primary ONLY for:

   * buttons
   * active nav item
   * icon accents
   * badges

No purple overlays. No bright bars.

# ✅ SECTION 2 — **Hero Overlay Fix (the biggest visual problem)**

### Current:

The overlay is **too purple** and **too opaque**, drowning the image.

### Required Fix:

Hero image overlay gradient MUST be:

**Neutral slate/black**
with **40–55% opacity**.

### New Overlay Code (copy/paste):

```tsx
backgroundImage: `
  linear-gradient(
    to bottom right,
    rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.35),
    rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.55)
  ),
  url('${heroImageUrl}')
`,
backgroundSize: 'cover',
backgroundPosition: 'center',
```

### Notes:

* Always use **slate-900** tones (15,23,42).
* NEVER use theme primary color in hero overlay.
* This ensures contrast for phone numbers and CTAs while preserving the photo.

---

# ✅ SECTION 3 — **Fix the Phone Number Issue**

Right now the phone number sits on a harsh purple background → low readability + ugly.

### Required Fixes:

1. Phone badge uses **neutral background**, NOT theme color:

   ```css
   background: rgba(255,255,255,0.14);
   backdrop-filter: blur(6px);
   border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.15);
   color: white;
   ```

2. Hover state:

   ```css
   background: rgba(255,255,255,0.22);
   ```

3. Text color always `#FFF`.

This matches high-end HVAC/contractor websites.

# ✅ SECTION 4 — **Industry-Accurate Image Generation Prompts**

This is the other major problem: AI is generating **wrong subject matter**
(e.g., *kitchen interior instead of restaurant*).

Here are the corrected prompts:

---

## ✔ Trades (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing) Background:

```
Ultra-realistic wide hero photo of a modern [industry] project in [city]. 
Outdoor environment preferred. Professional lighting. No people. 
Show equipment or relevant work environment. 
Landscape orientation. Clean, high-end, service-business aesthetic. 
No text, no artificial digital artifacts.
```

**Examples:**

* HVAC → exterior AC unit, ducts, furnace, service truck
* Plumbing → bathrooms, pipes, tools, utility rooms
* Roofing → shingles, ladders, rooftops

---

## ✔ Restaurants / Bars:

```
Ultra-realistic hero image of a modern bar or restaurant interior in [city]. 
Warm lighting, wide angle, clean modern design. 
No people. No text. Landscape orientation.
```

---

## ✔ Health Clinics / Med Spa:

```
Modern medical office interior, clean white surfaces, soft natural lighting. 
No patients. No text. Landscape orientation. High-end aesthetic.
```

---

## ✔ Legal / Financial Services:

```
Modern office interior, warm natural lighting, wood + glass materials, 
professional clean design. 
No people. No text. Landscape orientation.
```

---

### Developer instructions:

* Add `industry → prompt` mapping in the generation worker.
* Replace generic prompts with these **industry-specific templates**.
* Always request **landscape / hero-width** images.
* Always store the first generated image as `heroImageUrl`.

---

# ✅ SECTION 5 — **Improve Website Copy Prompts**

Right now the hero headlines are generic.

Here are the corrected prompts:

---

### HERO HEADLINE:

```
Write a confident, benefit-focused headline for a [industry] business in [city]. 
Keep it 3–6 words max. No exclamation marks.
```

**Examples:**

* “Comfort Starts Here”
* “Plumbing You Can Trust”
* “Stress-Free Electrical Service”

---

### HERO SUBHEADLINE:

```
Write a 1–2 sentence subheadline explaining what this business does, 
emphasizing reliability, quality, and local service. 
Use everyday language, no jargon.
```

---

### SERVICES BLURBS:

```
List 4 common services for a [industry] business. 
For each service, write a short description (< 12 words) explaining what it includes.
```

---

### WHY CHOOSE US BULLETS:

```
Create 3 short bullet points (< 10 words each) explaining why customers trust this business.
```

---

# ✅ SECTION 6 — **Correct Image Selection Logic**

Ensure:

1. If the user uploads a hero image → always use it.
2. Else → choose AI-generated hero image.
3. Else → fallback to an industry stock image.

For other sections:

* Services → use 1–2 secondary images from AI or upload gallery.
* About → small subtle background shapes (not images).

Hero image should ALWAYS exist now.

---

# ✅ SECTION 7 — **Fix Color Overwrites in the Header**

The top bar’s purple background is bleeding through because theme primary is being applied to header background.

### Correct behavior:

* Header should either be **transparent over hero**, OR
* Use **neutral frosted glass**:

```css
background: rgba(255,255,255,0.12);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
```

Theme colors should *only* be used for:

* CTAs
* Selected nav item
* Icons

Never background surfaces.

# 🎯 FINAL DEV TICKET (copy/paste for your developer)

> **Title: Fit + Finish Fixes for Generated Sites (Hero, Color System, Prompts)**
>
> **Summary**: Improve generated site quality by fixing color palettes, overlays, AI image prompts, hero image selection, and header contrast issues.
>
> **Requirements**:
>
> 1. Limit each theme to **3 colors** (primary, secondary, neutral). No bright/neon.
> 2. Remove theme-based hero overlays. Use neutral gradient:
>
>    * rgba(15,23,42,0.35) → rgba(15,23,42,0.55).
> 3. Always use a hero image (upload → uploads → AI → fallback).
> 4. Add industry-specific AI prompts for hero image generation (see attached).
> 5. Improve copy prompts (headline, subheadline, services, bullets).
> 6. Fix phone number badge (use frosted-glass neutral background).
> 7. Header background must be neutral or transparent — NEVER theme primary.
> 8. Ensure hero text remains readable with new overlay.
> 9. Ensure final hero image looks natural, not tinted or over-darkened.
>
> After implementation, preview sites should look more like **LuckyThunderPropertyManagement.com quality**, especially the hero.
