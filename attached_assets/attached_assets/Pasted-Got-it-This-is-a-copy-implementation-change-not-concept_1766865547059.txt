Got it. This is a **copy + implementation** change, not conceptual. Below is exactly what you need.

---

## Final copy (tight, minimal, conversion-safe)

### Primary CTA (unchanged, dominant)

**Free Health Check**

### Secondary inline text (directly under the input / button)

Small, subtle, text-only — not a button.

> **No website yet?** Generate a free one instead →

That’s it.
No extra verbs. No “run”. No competing CTA weight.

---

## Behavior (important)

* Clicking **Free Health Check** = current flow (URL → scan → report).
* Clicking **Generate a free one instead**:

  * Skips URL requirement
  * Routes to your **Free Website Generator** flow
  * Preloads industry/location if already known

This makes it a **fork**, not friction.

---

## Replit implementation prompt (copy-paste)

Use this exactly as a task for Replit:

> Update the homepage hero CTA behavior:
>
> 1. Keep the primary CTA labeled **“Free Health Check”**.
>
> 2. Remove all instances of “Run Free Site Scan” or “Run”.
>
> 3. Directly beneath the primary CTA, add a **secondary inline text link** (not a button) that reads:
>
>    **“No website yet? Generate a free one instead →”**
>
> 4. Style the secondary link as subtle helper text:
>
>    * Smaller font
>    * Neutral color
>    * Inline under the primary CTA
>    * Does not visually compete with the primary CTA
>
> 5. Clicking the secondary link should:
>
>    * Bypass the URL input requirement
>    * Route users to the Free Website Generation flow
>    * Pass along any known context (industry, location, prior answers) if available
>
> 6. Ensure terminology consistency across the app:
>
>    * Use **“Free Health Check”** everywhere in UI copy
>    * Do not use “Run”, “Scan”, or “SEO Scan” as primary CTAs
>
> This change should not alter the existing health check flow logic — only add a secondary path for users without a website.

## Why this works (quick rationale)

* Keeps **one primary action**
* Gives non-website users an escape hatch without decision overload
* Preserves funnel clarity
* Matches how high-conversion SaaS handle alternate entry points

If you want next:

* I can give you the exact JSX snippet for `Home.tsx`
* Or wire the secondary path directly into your existing generator worker contract
