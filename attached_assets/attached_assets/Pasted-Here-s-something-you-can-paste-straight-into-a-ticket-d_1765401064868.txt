Here’s something you can paste straight into a ticket / doc for your dev.

---

## 0. High-level goals

We’re upgrading the site generator so:

* The preview site looks like a real, modern marketing site (LuckyThunder-style), not a basic gradient landing page.
* User setup is still simple, but we collect slightly richer info.
* We have a standard nav on generated sites.
* We support images (upload or AI placeholder).
* We give clear messaging that if they like the preview, Arclo will keep building it out.

Everything below is what needs to change.

---

## 1. Onboarding form changes (/start flow)

### 1.1 Step 1 – Business basics

Add/update fields:

* Business name (required)
* Business type (existing dropdown, keep)
* City / service area (existing field, keep)
* Existing website (optional, keep)
* **Business description (optional)**

  * Textarea: “Describe your business in 1–3 sentences.”

Logic:

* If description is blank, generate one with AI using business name, business type, and city.

  * Prompt:
    “Write a friendly, 2–3 sentence description for a [business_type] called [business_name] in [city]. Focus on local service, reliability, and trust.”

### 1.2 Step 2 – Brand & Images

Add/update fields:

* Brand style (radio buttons):

  * Clean & modern
  * Warm & friendly
  * Bold & high-contrast
* Color theme (3–4 swatches; see theme tokens below)
* Logo upload (existing; keep)
* **Hero image upload (optional)**
* **Additional images upload (optional; multiple)**

Data:

* Store description, brand style, selected theme, and image references in whatever “site generation input” object we pass into the worker.

---

## 2. Theme system (curated palettes)

Introduce a simple theme system to avoid harsh colors.

Create a `themes.ts` (or similar) with 4–6 palettes, e.g.:

* `indigoSky`

  * primary: `#4F46E5`
  * accent: `#0EA5E9`
  * bg: `#F3F4F6`
* `tealEmerald`

  * primary: `#0F766E`
  * accent: `#10B981`
  * bg: `#F1F5F9`
* `navyGold`

  * primary: `#0F172A`
  * accent: `#F59E0B`
  * bg: `#F9FAFB`
* `plumPink`

  * primary: `#7C3AED`
  * accent: `#EC4899`
  * bg: `#F8FAFC`

Mapping logic:

* Based on brand style + business type, pick a theme (e.g. trades → tealEmerald, clinics → plumPink, etc.).
* Use theme variables for:

  * hero gradient overlay
  * CTA buttons
  * section headings
  * borders / chips
  * not for big flat neon backgrounds.

## 3. v2 homepage layout for generated sites

Replace the simple gradient hero with a proper multi-section layout.

Template structure (single-page scroll for now):

1. **Standard Nav (see section 4)**
2. **Hero section (above the fold)**
3. Trust / highlight strip
4. Services section
5. About / Why Choose Us section
6. Service areas / locations list
7. Contact / CTA section
8. Footer

### 3.1 Hero section

Layout:

* Background: hero image (see section 5) with dark overlay using theme primary.
* Left column:

  * H1 (derived from inputs), e.g.
    “[City] [Service] You Can Count On”
  * Subheadline: use the business description (or AI version), max 2–3 lines.
  * Primary CTA button:

    * For trades: “Get a Free Quote”
    * For clinics: “Book an Appointment”
  * Secondary CTA link/button: “View Services”.
* Right column (optional, if it fits the layout):

  * 2–3 “pill” badges:

    * “Licensed & Insured”
    * “Local & Trusted”
    * “Fast Response” / “Same-Day Service”

### 3.2 Trust / highlight strip

Just under hero: narrow strip with icons + labels (3–4 items), e.g.:

* “Up-front pricing”
* “Emergency service”
* “5-star reviews”

### 3.3 Services section

Use business type to seed service cards.

* Title: “Our Services”
* 3–6 cards with:

  * service name
  * 1-line description

If we have an industry preset (plumbing, HVAC, etc.), use a static set + AI to rewrite blurbs. Otherwise have AI infer 3–4 services from the description.

### 3.4 About / Why Choose Us

* Title: “Why Choose [Business Name]” or “About Us”
* One short paragraph from description
* 3 bullets AI-generated, focusing on:

  * reliability
  * quality
  * local expertise / customer service

### 3.5 Service areas

* Title: “Proudly Serving”
* List of city / neighborhood names from input (if user gave multiple, or derive nearby from city if we have that logic later).

### 3.6 Contact / CTA

* Big block with clear CTA:

  * Headline: “Ready to Get Started?”
  * Buttons: “Call Now” (if phone provided, mailto:tel link) and “Request a Free Quote”.
* Placeholder contact form if we don’t have real form integration yet.

---

## 4. Standard nav for generated sites

Every generated site should have a consistent nav at the top of the page.

Layout:

* Left:

  * Logo (use uploaded logo if available; fallback to text-based initials)
  * Business name text

* Right nav items (scroll anchors):

  * Home
  * Services
  * About
  * Areas Served
  * Contact

Implementation notes:

* Use in-page anchor links (e.g. `#hero`, `#services`, `#about`, `#areas`, `#contact`).
* Sticky nav on scroll if possible.
* Use theme primary for active item / underline.
* Keep nav height compact and modern (similar style to your Arclo marketing header, but simplified).

---

## 5. Images logic

We need to fill hero and at least 1–2 other sections with meaningful images.

Priority order:

1. If user uploads a hero image → use that in hero.
2. Else if user uploads any images → pick the widest / highest-res as hero, others in Services/About.
3. Else → auto-generate images using AI based on business type + description.

AI prompt for hero:

> “Ultra-realistic, modern website hero photo of [business_type] work in [city]. Clean, bright, professional, landscape orientation. No text.”

Generate at least:

* 1 hero image
* 1–2 secondary images (e.g. “team at work”, “happy customer”, “truck / storefront”).

Styling:

* Always apply a dark overlay in CSS so text is readable:

  ```css
  background:
    linear-gradient(to bottom right, rgba(15,23,42,0.78), rgba(15,23,42,0.6)),
    url('/path/to/hero.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
  ```

* Secondary images can be cards or background images in services/about sections.

---

## 6. Text/copy generation details

Use the new description + business type to drive better text:

* Business tagline / hero H1:

  * Template: “[City] [ServiceType] You Can Count On”
  * ServiceType derived from business type (e.g. plumbing → “Plumbing Services”).

* Subheadline:

  * From description directly (trim to ~180 characters).

* Services:

  * If we have industry presets, use them; else ask AI:
    “Based on this description, list 4 key services this business likely offers as short bullet phrases.”

* About bullets:

  * AI prompt:
    “Based on this description, write 3 short bullet points on why a customer should choose this company (each < 12 words).”

Make sure copy is:

* sentence case
* no all-caps
* short and scannable.

---

## 7. Preview page messaging: “We’ll keep building it out”

On the preview page (right panel “What Arclo did for you already”), add another section under the checklist:

Text block:

* Heading: “Like this preview? We’ll keep building it out for you.”
* Bullets:

  * “We’ll add more service and location pages.”
  * “We’ll keep tuning your SEO every day.”
  * “We’ll watch for issues and fix them automatically.”

And above the “Claim Your Website” button, add a one-liner:

> “If you like what you see, claim it and Arclo will keep improving this site for you automatically.”

No change to button label; keep “Claim Your Website”.

---

## 8. Implementation checklist (for you to track)

1. Update `/start` step 1 with description field + AI fallback.
2. Update `/start` step 2 with brand style, theme selection, hero/extra image uploading.
3. Implement theme tokens and selection logic.
4. Implement v2 homepage template for generated sites (hero, nav, sections).
5. Implement image pipeline (upload + AI fallback).
6. Wire new copy generation logic (H1, subheadline, services, about bullets).
7. Update preview page to use the new template and show new messaging about ongoing improvements.
8. Confirm generated site has a standard nav and looks modern on desktop and mobile.

If your dev builds to this spec, we’ll get from “basic gradient site” to “this looks like LuckyThunder quality” while still keeping the flow relatively simple for the user.

Once they’ve made a first pass, send me screenshots or a link and I can tighten copy, spacing, and section order.
