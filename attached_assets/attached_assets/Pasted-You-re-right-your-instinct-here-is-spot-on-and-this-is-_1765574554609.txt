You’re right — your instinct here is spot on, and this is a very important refinement.

What you’re feeling is real:
the current Results page accidentally tells the story “we have 3 examples”, instead of the story you actually want to tell, which is:

“This is a repeatable transformation we apply to businesses like yours.”

Below I’ll do three things:
	1.	Validate and sharpen the idea (why this is the right direction)
	2.	Propose a much stronger Results page structure
	3.	Give you a single, high-quality prompt you can hand to the agent to implement it

No fluff, no theory — this is conversion architecture.

⸻

1. Validation: You’re Solving the Right Problem

What’s broken today (psychologically)
	•	Showing 3 concrete examples anchors scarcity
	•	It triggers:
“Is this all they have?”
	•	It unintentionally creates doubt instead of confidence
	•	It also visually unbalances the page, exactly as you noticed

What you actually want to communicate
	•	This is not about showcasing clients
	•	This is about showing a pattern
	•	Arclo isn’t a portfolio company — it’s a system

So yes: shifting from “examples” to “before → after → possible” is absolutely the right move.

This is how:
	•	Shopify
	•	Webflow
	•	Stripe
	•	HubSpot

all communicate results early on — they show trajectories, not logos.

⸻

2. The Right Results Page Structure (High-Level)

Here’s the mental model the Results page should convey:

“Where most businesses start → where Arclo gets them → what’s possible next”

Think in states, not customers.

⸻

3. Recommended Results Page Layout

SECTION 1 — “Where Most Businesses Start”

This normalizes pain and builds trust.

Title:
Most businesses come to Arclo in one of these situations

Cards (3–4 max):
	•	Google Business Profile only, no real website
	•	A website exists, but no traffic or calls
	•	Traffic exists, but no idea where leads come from
	•	An outdated site that hasn’t been touched in years

Each card should feel recognizable, not shamey.

⸻

SECTION 2 — “What Arclo Changes Immediately”

This is the core value section.

Title:
What changes when you use Arclo

Bulleted, outcome-driven:
	•	A professional website built for your business and location
	•	Clear pages for the services you offer
	•	A site structured to help customers find and contact you
	•	Automatic improvements over time

This reinforces that Arclo is hands-off.

⸻

SECTION 3 — “Before → After → Possible”

This is the heart of your idea.

Instead of real clients, use archetypes.

Example archetype card:
Local Plumbing Business
	•	Before Arclo
	•	Basic site or no site
	•	No service pages
	•	No idea how customers find them
	•	With Arclo
	•	Clean, modern website
	•	Pages for plumbing services
	•	Clear calls and contact flow
	•	Over Time
	•	More searches covered
	•	More service areas represented
	•	Better visibility and consistency

Repeat with:
	•	HVAC
	•	Electrical
	•	Law firm / professional services

This makes Arclo feel scalable and proven, even without logos.

⸻

SECTION 4 — “The Art of What’s Possible”

This is what you explicitly asked for, and it’s powerful.

Title:
What’s possible when your website runs itself

Bullets like:
	•	Expanding into new service areas without rebuilding your site
	•	Adding new services without redesigning pages
	•	Seeing what’s working without digging into tools
	•	Having a site that improves even when you’re busy

This reframes Arclo as infrastructure, not a one-time fix.

⸻

SECTION 5 — Soft CTA Back to Action

Do not make this aggressive.

Copy example:

You don’t need to know how to do any of this.
Arclo handles it automatically.

Button:
See what Arclo would build for my business

⸻

4. What This Solves (Why It’s Better)
	•	Removes the “only 3 examples” problem
	•	Makes the product feel repeatable
	•	Reduces risk perception
	•	Aligns with your philosophy of “done-for-you”
	•	Keeps the page balanced and narrative-driven
	•	Scales as you grow (no need to constantly add new logos)

This is a much stronger Results page for where Arclo is today.

⸻

5. The Prompt to Give Your Agent (Copy/Paste)

Here’s the exact prompt you asked for.

⸻

PROMPT: Redesign the Results Page to Show Transformation & Possibility

We need to redesign the Results page to move away from a small set of concrete examples and instead show the transformation Arclo creates for businesses.

Goals
	•	Make the page feel confident and scalable, not portfolio-limited
	•	Show where businesses start, what Arclo changes, and what’s possible over time
	•	Keep everything non-technical and outcome-focused
	•	Balance the page visually and narratively

⸻

Part 1 — Replace “Examples” with “Starting Points”

Add a section titled:

“Where Most Businesses Start”

Show 3–4 cards describing common starting situations:
	•	Google Business Profile only, no real website
	•	Website exists but doesn’t generate traffic or calls
	•	No visibility into how customers find the business
	•	Outdated website that hasn’t been updated in years

These should feel relatable, not critical.

⸻

Part 2 — Add “What Arclo Changes”

Add a section titled:

“What Arclo Changes”

Describe the immediate improvements Arclo provides:
	•	Professional website built for the business
	•	Clear service and location pages
	•	Designed to help customers find and contact the business
	•	Automatic improvements over time

Use plain language and avoid SEO jargon.

⸻

Part 3 — Add “Before → After → Possible” Archetypes

Create a section titled:

“What This Looks Like for Businesses Like Yours”

Use archetypes, not real clients:
	•	Plumbing business
	•	HVAC business
	•	Electrical business
	•	Professional services (law, accounting, etc.)

For each archetype, show:
	•	Before Arclo
	•	With Arclo
	•	Over time

Focus on clarity, visibility, and growth — not metrics.

⸻

Part 4 — Add “What’s Possible” Section

Add a section titled:

“The Art of What’s Possible”

Describe future-state benefits:
	•	Expanding services without rebuilding
	•	Expanding locations without redesigns
	•	Ongoing improvements without manual work
	•	Clear understanding of what’s working

This section should make Arclo feel like infrastructure, not a one-off tool.

⸻

Part 5 — End with a Soft CTA

End the page with:
	•	Reassuring copy that Arclo handles everything
	•	A CTA button:
“See what Arclo would build for my business”

⸻

Validation Checklist

Before finishing:
	•	Page does not feel like a client portfolio
	•	Page clearly communicates a repeatable transformation
	•	No technical jargon is used
	•	The page feels balanced and confident
	•	A small business owner can easily see themselves in the story

⸻

Final Thought

This is a very good product instinct.
You’re shifting from “proof” to “pattern recognition”, which is exactly what you want at this stage.

If you want next, I can:
	•	Write the actual copy for each section
	•	Design the card layout logic
	•	Decide how this page evolves once you do have many clients
	•	Help you A/B test the Results page against the current version

Just tell me.
