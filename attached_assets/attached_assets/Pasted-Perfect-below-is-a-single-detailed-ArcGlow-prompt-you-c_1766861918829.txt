Perfect — below is a single, detailed ArcGlow prompt you can hand directly to your development agent plus a full Figma-ready homepage wireframe with exact copy, layout blocks, and behavior.
This assumes Tailwind CSS + React (Next.js-style), which matches how Arclo already looks and how you’re building in Replit. If that assumption is wrong, you can swap Tailwind for your system and keep everything else verbatim.

🔧 ARC GLOW DEVELOPMENT PROMPT

Project: Arclo Homepage Redesign (Friction-Free SEO Scan Pivot)
Target Page: / (marketing homepage only)
Design System: Tailwind CSS (reuse existing Arclo tokens, spacing, colors, typography)
Do NOT redesign the brand. Preserve the current Arclo look.

⸻

1. GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Rebuild the Arclo homepage to position the product as a friction-free SEO diagnostic and AI operations platform, where:
	•	The primary CTA is a free website scan
	•	The scan requires ONLY a website URL
	•	No GA4, Search Console, logins, or setup
	•	Users can run only one free scan
	•	After the report, users are guided to “Staff Your AI Crew”
	•	The homepage must feel clean, professional, SMB-friendly
	•	NO video-game visuals, NO star maps, NO heavy animations

⸻

2. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (PAGE SECTIONS)

The homepage must contain these sections in order:
	1.	Hero (Primary conversion)
	2.	Trust + friction removal strip
	3.	“What the free scan includes” (4 cards)
	4.	Report preview (visual placeholder)
	5.	AI Crew introduction (light, non-gamey)
	6.	How it works (3 steps)
	7.	Pricing teaser (very light)
	8.	FAQ (conversion objections)
	9.	Final CTA band
