I pulled up arclo.pro. Right now the positioning is “Automated Websites & SEO for Small Businesses” with the lead promise “Get a professional website built in under 60 seconds,” and the page renders a JS-only experience (“Please enable JavaScript to use Arclo.”).  ￼

If you want to pivot to “free analysis → autopilot,” you can keep the website generator, but it can’t be the hero anymore. Here’s a clean repack + developer instructions.

Repackage ArcClo Pro
	1.	New primary value prop (above the fold)
Replace “build a website in 60 seconds” with:

Free Google Health Check for your business
Find exactly what’s blocking you from ranking in Google, and get a prioritized fix plan in minutes.

Primary CTA: Run Free Health Check
Secondary CTA: Generate a website (move this under Tools)

Why: The health check creates the instant “aha” for people who don’t know SEO, and it works whether they have a website already or not.
	2.	Keep it broad, but use “presets” to feel specific
Don’t pick one vertical publicly. Instead:

	•	Let the user pick a business type during the health check: Healthcare, Home Services (HVAC/plumbing/electrical), Legal, Dental, Med Spa, Property Management, Other
	•	That choice only changes the keyword groups and page template recommendations, not your entire product.

This keeps you broad while still delivering the “this feels custom” effect that made your AustinRegen report hit.
	3.	Move Website Generator to Tools
Navigation:

	•	Free Health Check (primary)
	•	Product (Autopilot)
	•	Examples
	•	Pricing
	•	Tools (Website Generator, maybe “Local SEO Landing Page Builder,” etc.)
	•	Login

	4.	Fix the marketing-site crawlability immediately
Your current landing content is basically a JS gate. That’s bad for trust and for your own SEO. At minimum, make the marketing pages server-rendered / statically generated so Google can crawl them without requiring JS.  ￼

Developer instructions

A. Information architecture + routes
Marketing (public, crawlable)
	•	/ (new hero: Free Health Check)
	•	/health-check (landing + start)
	•	/health-check/result/:report_id (shareable report page, no login required unless you want gating)
	•	/product (Autopilot explained: monitor → diagnose → recommend → safe apply)
	•	/pricing
	•	/examples (real screenshots/case studies; no JS-only placeholder)
	•	/tools (hub)
	•	/tools/website-generator (existing flow)
	•	/legal/privacy, /legal/terms

App (authenticated)
	•	/app (dashboard)
	•	/app/sites
	•	/app/sites/:id/reports
	•	/app/sites/:id/integrations (GSC/GA4)
	•	/app/sites/:id/settings (safe mode, approve rules)
	•	/app/billing

B. “Free Health Check” flow (the productized version of your email)
Step 1: Input
	•	URL
	•	Business type preset (optional but recommended)
	•	City/Service area (optional; attempt to infer but allow override)
	•	Email (optional for delivery; don’t require upfront if you want max conversions)

Step 2: Run jobs (async)
Kick off these workers (minimum viable):
	•	Crawl & Render (technical findings + render check)
	•	Lightweight keyword/SERP snapshot (small set, per preset)
	•	Competitor snapshot (recurring domains from SERPs)

Step 3: Output report with an “aha moment”
Top section (3 cards):
	•	Coverage Score (0–100)
	•	Rank Eligibility Score (0–100)
	•	Top 3 blockers (plain English)

Then sections:
	•	What’s working (1–3 bullets)
	•	What’s holding you back (prioritized list)
	•	Keyword targets + current visibility buckets
	•	Technical findings (counts + top examples)
	•	30/60/90 plan (templated, prescriptive)
	•	CTA: Turn on Autopilot

C. Scoring model (simple, explainable)
Coverage Score
	•	Define 6–10 keyword groups per preset (service + condition/problem terms for clinics; service + city for trades)
	•	Score based on whether your crawl finds an intent-aligned page (URL/title/H1/content match)

Rank Eligibility Score
Start at 100 and subtract penalties:
	•	Internal 4xx
	•	Noindex/canonical anomalies on money pages
	•	Render failures / blank main content
	•	Image bloat / CWV risk signals (even basic “images >100kb” counts)
	•	Title/H1 issues on priority pages

D. Data model and APIs (so it plugs into your existing services)
Tables (or collections):
	•	sites (id, url, preset, city, created_at)
	•	health_check_reports (id, site_id, status, created_at, summary_json, report_markdown, share_token)
	•	findings (report_id, service_name, severity, category, count, examples_json)
	•	jobs (id, report_id, service_name, status, started_at, ended_at, error)

Endpoints:
	•	POST /api/health-check/run { url, preset, city, email? } -> { report_id }
	•	GET /api/health-check/status/:report_id
	•	GET /api/health-check/report/:report_id (public if share_token valid)
	•	POST /api/health-check/email/:report_id

E. Autopilot conversion path (what happens after the report)
When user clicks “Turn on Autopilot”:
	•	Create account (magic link is fine)
	•	Connect GSC/GA4 (OAuth)
	•	Pick safe mode:
	•	Recommend-only (default)
	•	Apply via PR (requires GitHub connection)
	•	CMS publish (later)
	•	Start daily monitoring schedule (orchestrator)

F. Critical: make marketing pages SSR/SSG
Implementation requirement:
	•	The marketing site must render meaningful HTML without JS for /, /health-check, /product, /pricing, /examples.
	•	The interactive widgets can hydrate after, but the core copy + CTAs must be in the initial HTML. Your current “enable JavaScript” gate is exactly what you don’t want on the sales site.  ￼

Replit implementation prompt (copy/paste)

Build the ArcClo Pro pivot to “Free Google Health Check → Autopilot” while keeping the Website Generator under Tools.
	1.	Marketing site changes (must be crawlable)

	•	Convert marketing routes to SSR/SSG so pages render full HTML without requiring JS:
	•	/ (new hero: Free Google Health Check)
	•	/health-check
	•	/product
	•	/pricing
	•	/examples
	•	/tools
	•	/tools/website-generator (existing)
	•	Update homepage copy:
	•	H1: “Free Google Health Check for your business”
	•	Subhead: “See what’s blocking you from ranking and get a prioritized fix plan in minutes.”
	•	Primary CTA: “Run Free Health Check”
	•	Secondary CTA (in Tools area): “Generate a website”
	•	Navigation order: Health Check, Product, Examples, Pricing, Tools, Login

	2.	Health Check flow (public, no login required to run)
UI routes:

	•	/health-check (form)
	•	/health-check/running/:report_id (progress)
	•	/health-check/result/:report_id (report, shareable)

Form fields:
	•	website URL (required)
	•	business preset (optional): Healthcare, Home Services, Legal, Dental, Med Spa, Property Management, Other
	•	city/service area (optional)
	•	email (optional; used to send the report)

Backend:
	•	POST /api/health-check/run -> returns report_id
	•	Queue async jobs:
	•	Crawl & Render worker (technical findings + render visibility)
	•	SERP/keyword snapshot worker (small keyword set by preset)
	•	Competitor snapshot worker (top recurring domains)
	•	GET /api/health-check/status/:report_id for polling
	•	GET /api/health-check/report/:report_id (protected by share_token for public access)
	•	POST /api/health-check/email/:report_id to send via Notifications service

Data model:
	•	sites, health_check_reports, findings, jobs as described above.

Report output (must match the “AustinRegen style”):
Top cards:
	•	Coverage Score (0–100)
	•	Rank Eligibility Score (0–100)
	•	Top 3 blockers (plain-English)

Sections:
	•	What’s working
	•	What’s holding you back (prioritized)
	•	Keyword targets table (keyword, current bucket, recommended page)
	•	Technical findings summary (counts + top examples)
	•	30/60/90-day plan (templated, prescriptive)
Primary CTA: “Turn on Autopilot” -> account creation + connect GSC/GA4

Scoring:
	•	Coverage Score based on intent-aligned pages found for preset keyword groups
	•	Rank Eligibility Score: start 100 minus weighted penalties (4xx, noindex/canonical anomalies, render failures, heavy images/perf risks, title/H1 issues)

	3.	Keep Website Generator but reposition

	•	Move the generator entry point under /tools and link it as secondary CTAs only.
	•	Do not lead with “website in 60 seconds” on the homepage.

If you want, paste what your current site generator flow URL is inside the app (the internal route), and I’ll map it cleanly into /tools/website-generator with the right CTAs and tracking events.
