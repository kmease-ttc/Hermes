Absolutely. Below is a clean, single agent prompt that covers both requirements without over-complicating the flow.

This is written so your agent/dev can implement it directly.

NEXT WORKSTREAM: Lead Capture, Notifications & Optional Contact Info

Agent Prompt

Objective

Add lightweight lead visibility and optional contact capture during site creation, without increasing friction or harming conversion.

Specifically:
	1.	Send Kevin an email every time a site is created
	2.	Allow users to optionally add phone/email during site generation
	3.	Use that contact info to improve the generated site
	4.	Do not make any of this feel required or heavy

⸻

PART 1 — Internal Notification on Site Creation (Required)

Behavior

Every time a user completes “Generate Free Site”, send an internal notification email.

Recipient

Kevin.mease@gmail.com

Trigger
	•	Fire immediately after a site is successfully generated (preview created)
	•	Do NOT wait for account creation or payment

Email Contents

Plain text or simple HTML is fine.

Include:
	•	Business name
	•	Industry
	•	City / service area
	•	Preview URL
	•	Timestamp
	•	Whether contact info was provided (yes/no)

Example subject:
“New site generated — {{business_name}}”

This email is internal only and should not be configurable in the UI yet.

⸻

PART 2 — Optional Contact Info During Site Creation (Required)

Placement

On the Generate Free Site form, add an Optional section below the required fields.

Label clearly:
“Optional (helps improve your site)”

Fields
	•	Phone number (optional)
	•	Email address (optional)

Rules:
	•	Do NOT require either field
	•	Do NOT block generation if empty
	•	Do NOT validate aggressively (basic format only)

⸻

PART 3 — How Contact Info Is Used (Critical)

If phone/email is provided:
	1.	Automatically include it in the generated site:
	•	Header or hero section (subtle)
	•	Contact section
	•	Footer
	2.	Use it consistently:
	•	Same phone/email everywhere
	•	No placeholders if provided

If NOT provided:
	•	Generate site without contact info
	•	Use generic CTA text like:
“Contact us” / “Get a quote”
	•	No fake phone numbers or emails

⸻

PART 4 — Data Storage

Store contact info at the site level, not user level.

Fields:
	•	site.phone (nullable)
	•	site.email (nullable)
	•	site.contact_source = user_provided | not_provided

This allows:
	•	later edits
	•	future setup services
	•	analytics integrations

⸻

PART 5 — UX Rules (Very Important)
	•	Never frame contact info as required
	•	Never slow down generation
	•	Never add extra steps
	•	Never prompt twice

Tone examples:
	•	“Optional”
	•	“You can add this later”
	•	“Helps customers contact you”

⸻

PART 6 — Future-Proofing (Do Not Implement Yet)

Just design for these later capabilities:
	•	Editing contact info post-generation
	•	Adding call tracking numbers
	•	Contact form routing
	•	SMS/email notifications

No need to build them now.

⸻

Definition of Done
	•	Kevin receives an email for every site generated
	•	Users can optionally add phone/email during creation
	•	Generated sites look better when contact info is provided
	•	No impact to conversion or speed
	•	No extra cognitive load

⸻

Why This Matters
	•	You get real-time visibility into demand
	•	You can spot patterns early (industry, city, quality)
	•	Sites instantly feel more “real” and trustworthy
	•	You don’t sacrifice funnel speed

⸻

If you want next, the most logical follow-ups are:
	1.	Simple CRM / lead list view for generated sites, or
	2.	Contact form + routing (email/SMS) setup service

Say which one and I’ll write that prompt.
