Perfect.
Step 3 = Images + alt-text system for the blog so your content actually ranks and looks intentional.

Below is a complete, drop-in instruction set for the agent covering:
	•	image strategy
	•	image prompts
	•	placement rules
	•	alt-text rules
	•	consistency with Arclo’s brand + audience

No code, no fluff.

STEP 3 — BLOG IMAGE & ALT-TEXT SYSTEM (ARCLO)

Purpose

Make every blog post:
	•	visually credible to small business owners
	•	clearly understood by Google
	•	consistent with Arclo’s “done-for-you” positioning
	•	not generic stock-photo nonsense

Images should support understanding, not decorate.

⸻

1. Image Requirements Per Blog Post

Every blog post must include:

Required
	1.	1 featured image (hero) at the top
	2.	1 supporting image inside the content

Optional (for longer posts)
	•	Up to 2 additional images if they add clarity

Absolute limits
	•	Never more than 4 images per post
	•	Never zero images

⸻

2. Image Style Rules (Critical)

All blog images must follow these rules:
	•	Real-world, small-business context
	•	Friendly, modern, human
	•	No abstract “AI blobs”
	•	No generic corporate offices
	•	No people in suits unless topic is enterprise
	•	No over-the-top tech visuals (servers, code, robots)

Think:

“Would a plumber / bakery owner feel like this image is about their business?”

If not → regenerate.

⸻

3. Featured Image Prompt Template (Hero Image)

Use this for the top image of every blog post.

Prompt Template

Create a clean, professional blog header image for a post about: {BLOG_TOPIC}.

Audience: local small business owners (plumbers, HVAC, bakers, cleaners, etc.).

Style:
- Real-world small business environment
- Friendly and approachable
- Modern but not corporate
- Natural lighting
- Shallow depth of field
- No text in the image

Avoid:
- Generic office scenes
- Coding screens
- People in suits
- Abstract or futuristic visuals

Examples by Topic

Blog: “How Local Businesses Get Found on Google”

Show a small business storefront or service professional in a real environment, with a customer interacting or searching on a phone.

Blog: “Why Service Pages Matter”

Show a service professional at work (HVAC repair, plumbing, etc.) with tools or equipment visible.

Blog: “Why Websites Don’t Get Calls”

Show a person frustrated looking at a phone or laptop, or a clear call button on a mobile phone.

⸻

4. Supporting Image Prompt Template (In-Post Image)

Use this once inside the blog body.

Prompt Template

Create a supporting image that visually explains: {SECTION_TOPIC}.

Audience: non-technical small business owners.

Style:
- Simple, real-world scenario
- Helps explain the concept visually
- Clean and uncluttered
- No text in the image

Example Section Topics
	•	“Service pages”
	•	“Location pages”
	•	“Call now buttons”
	•	“Customers finding a business online”

⸻

5. Alt-Text Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

Alt text is not for humans.
It’s for Google and accessibility.

Alt-Text Requirements
	•	1 sentence
	•	Descriptive, not promotional
	•	Naturally includes the blog’s primary or supporting keyword
	•	Describes what’s actually in the image

Alt-Text Template

{Brief description of the image}, showing how {topic} helps small businesses.

Good Alt-Text Examples
	•	“Local HVAC technician helping a homeowner, showing how service pages help customers find businesses.”
	•	“Small business owner reviewing calls on a phone, illustrating how websites can generate more customer leads.”
	•	“Bakery storefront with customers inside, showing how local businesses get found on Google.”

Bad Alt-Text (Do Not Use)
	•	“SEO image”
	•	“Marketing graphic”
	•	“Hero image”
	•	“Business photo”
	•	“AI generated image”

⸻

6. Image–Keyword Alignment Rules

For every blog post:
	•	Featured image alt-text must include:
	•	the primary keyword OR a very close variation
	•	Supporting image alt-text must include:
	•	one supporting keyword from the same cluster

Never force keywords unnaturally.

⸻

7. Consistency & Relevance Checks (Quality Gate)

Before publishing a blog post, the agent must confirm:
	1.	Featured image clearly matches the blog topic
	2.	Image feels relevant to local businesses
	3.	No generic corporate imagery
	4.	Alt text exists and is descriptive
	5.	Image doesn’t conflict with Arclo’s brand tone
	6.	Image would make sense to a plumber/baker, not just a marketer

If any check fails → regenerate.

⸻

8. Image Source Priority

Use this order:
	1.	AI-generated image using the prompts above
	2.	Curated fallback image (only if AI fails twice)
	3.	Never leave image empty

Do NOT reuse the same image across multiple posts.

⸻

9. How This Connects to Step 2 (Keyword Map)

Each blog image supports Step 2 keywords:
	•	Primary blog keyword → featured image alt-text
	•	Supporting keywords → in-post image alt-text

This reinforces topical authority without keyword stuffing.

⸻

10. Agent Summary (Copy/Paste)

For every Arclo blog post:
	•	Add 1 featured image and 1 supporting image.
	•	Use real-world, small-business imagery.
	•	Generate images with topic-specific prompts.
	•	Write descriptive alt-text using the blog’s keywords naturally.
	•	Reject generic corporate or abstract visuals.
	•	Validate relevance before publishing.

⸻

Step 3 is complete.

You now have:
	•	a consistent image system
	•	SEO-correct alt-text
	•	brand-appropriate visuals
	•	zero reliance on stock junk

Next is Step 4:
	•	hub-and-spoke blog architecture

Say “Step 4” when you’re ready.
