You are a senior product + UX engineer refactoring the **Mission Control dashboard**. The current UI separates **Key Metrics** and **Crew**, which forces users to mentally map metrics → agents. This is unnecessary cognitive load.

Your task is to **collapse Key Metrics and Crew into ONE unified section** that shows:

* All core KPIs
* Which capabilities are active
* What’s left to do
* Whether things are improving

This section becomes the **primary operational view of the product**.

Do NOT remove crew dashboards yet. This is Mission Control only.

---

## CORE DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

* ❌ Remove the separate **Crew grid** from Mission Control
* ❌ Remove the separate **Key Metrics** section
* ✅ Replace both with a single section: **Capabilities & Performance** (working name)

This section answers:

> “What parts of my growth engine are working, and what do I need to do next?”

---

## NEW SECTION: “Capabilities & Performance”

### Section goals

For every capability (crew), show at a glance:

1. The **core KPI**
2. Whether it’s **active or locked**
3. How many **tasks** are open
4. A simple **trend signal**
5. A clear path to **review or enable**

---

## DATA MODEL (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each crew MUST define a **Core KPI**. No exceptions.

### Core KPI examples (define these explicitly)

* **Scotty (Technical SEO)**
  KPI: Pages with issues / Completion rate

* **Speedster (Performance)**
  KPI: Performance Score (or worst LCP)

* **Sentinel (Content Decay)**
  KPI: Pages losing traffic

* **Hemingway (Content Strategy)**
  KPI: Content Quality Score

* **Popular (Analytics)**
  KPI: Monthly Sessions

* **Lookout (Rank Tracking)**
  KPI: Keywords up/down

* **Atlas (AI Optimization)**
  KPI: AI readiness score

* **Draper (Paid Ads)**
  KPI: Conversions / CPA (locked until setup)

* **Socrates (Knowledge Base)**
  KPI: Insights generated

These KPIs must be visible even if the crew is not active (sample/locked state).

---

## CARD LAYOUT (PER CREW / CAPABILITY)

Each capability is rendered as a **Capability Card** in a grid.

### Card structure (top → bottom)

**1) Header**

* Crew avatar
* Crew name
* Status badge:

  * Active (green)
  * Locked (neutral)
  * Setup required (gold)

**2) Core KPI (BIG)**

* Large number or score
* Label underneath
* If locked:

  * Show blurred/sample value
  * Label “Sample”

**3) Trend indicator**

* Simple, not chart-heavy:

  * ↑ Improving
  * → Stable
  * ↓ Needs attention
* If no data yet:

  * “No trend yet”

**4) Task count**

* “X tasks open”
* If zero:

  * “All caught up”

**5) Action CTA**

* If active:

  * “Review” → navigates to crew dashboard
* If locked:

  * “Enable” → integration/setup flow
* If setup required:

  * “Configure”

Entire card should also be clickable to navigate to the crew dashboard.

---

## VISUAL RULES (CRITICAL)

### Active vs inactive highlighting

* **Active capabilities**:

  * Colored glow (crew color)
  * Slightly elevated
* **Inactive / locked**:

  * Neutral glass
  * No glow
* **Setup required**:

  * Gold outline/badge

This makes it immediately obvious what’s working for the user.

---

## TRENDING DATA (KEEP IT LIGHT)

Do NOT add charts here.

Trend is a **signal**, not analysis.

Allowed:

* Arrow + word (Improving / Stable / Declining)
* Small color cue (green / neutral / gold)

This is enough to create motion and value perception.

---

## NAVIGATION CHANGE (IMPORTANT)

### Mission Control

* Clicking a capability card navigates to:

  * `/crew/{crewId}`

### Left-hand Crew Navigation

For now:

* Keep it
* But visually de-emphasize it

Later (not now):

* You may remove it entirely once this experience proves sufficient

Do NOT remove left nav yet.

---

## WHAT TO REMOVE FROM MISSION CONTROL

* ❌ Separate Key Metrics section
* ❌ Separate Crew section
* ❌ Any duplicated KPI or task counts outside the unified section

Mission Control should have:

1. Primary Action Cards (Fix Everything / Send Reports / Run Diagnostics)
2. Recommended Actions
3. Your Wins
4. **Capabilities & Performance (NEW unified section)**

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before finishing, verify:

* Every crew has exactly ONE core KPI
* All KPIs are visible in one grid
* Active capabilities are clearly highlighted
* Locked capabilities still show enticing sample data
* Task counts are visible per capability
* Clicking a card takes you to the crew dashboard
* Mission Control feels simpler, not more complex

If a user can answer:

> “What’s working? What’s not? What should I click next?”

…without scanning multiple sections, this is correct.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Users don’t care about agents.
> They care about engines.**

This refactor turns Arclo from:

* “A bunch of tools”

into:

* **“A unified growth engine with moving parts.”**

Implement this next.
