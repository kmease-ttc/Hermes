SHIP SILHOUETTE FIX ONLY — DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER PART OF THE PAGE

The Crew page layout and compartments are correct, but the “ship” still looks like a rounded rectangle panel.
We need the container to READ AS A SHIP: hull silhouette + cockpit + engine bay.
Do NOT change left status tabs, cards below, copy, or overall layout. ONLY change the ship canvas visuals.

REQUIREMENT
Replace the current ship background container with a ship silhouette built as:
1) A single SVG “ship hull” shape (light ship against dark background)
2) The role compartments must appear INSIDE the hull (clipped/masked to the hull shape)
3) Add subtle ship details: cockpit window area at top, engine base at bottom (simple shapes ok)

IMPLEMENTATION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
A) Create an SVG hull silhouette component:
- File: components/crew/ShipHull.tsx
- Return an <svg> that includes:
  - A large hull path (rounded spaceship shape, not a rectangle)
  - Optional internal panel lines (very subtle)
  - A bottom “engine tray” protrusion
  - A top “cockpit” dome or window inset
- Provide a <clipPath id="shipClip"> using the hull path

B) Update ShipCanvas to use the hull clip path:
- Wrap the compartments grid in a container that is clipped to the hull:
  - Option 1: SVG foreignObject with clipPath
  - Option 2 (simpler): Use CSS clip-path: path('...') OR clipPath via inline SVG + mask
- The compartments MUST be clipped so they don’t extend beyond the hull edges.

C) Visual requirements:
- Hull fill: lighter than the page background (e.g., rgba(255,255,255,0.06–0.10))
- Hull border: subtle (white/10)
- Add a gentle highlight gradient near the top-left of hull (very subtle)
- Add engine glow dots at bottom (small cyan dots ok)
- Keep current compartment cards exactly as-is, just placed inside the hull

D) Layout: keep same compartment positions; just make the outer container the hull shape:
- No more big rounded rectangle.
- The hull silhouette should be clearly visible even if compartments are empty.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- The ship canvas reads as a spaceship silhouette (hull), not a generic panel
- Compartments are visibly inside the ship
- Compartment content is clipped to the hull boundaries
- No other sections of the page change

NOTE
If clipPath/path() is hard, implement a simpler approach:
- Use an SVG hull as the background image behind compartments
- Add a dark overlay outside the hull to fake clipping (mask layer)
But prioritize REAL clipping if possible.
