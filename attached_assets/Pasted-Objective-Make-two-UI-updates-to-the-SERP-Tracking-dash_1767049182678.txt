Objective
Make two UI updates to the SERP Tracking dashboard:

1. Add a row index (#) column to the “All Keywords” table that numbers each keyword from 1..N (N = total rows, e.g. 95)

2. Add a prompt-style interface on the dashboard that lets me add additional keywords into the canonical keyword list

3. Add Row Numbers to “All Keywords” Table
   Requirements

* Add a new first column on the far left labeled “#”
* Each row displays its index based on the current table ordering:

  * First row = 1, second row = 2, etc.
* If there are 95 keywords, number 1–95
* If the user changes sorting/filtering later, the numbering should reflect the visible order (index within the current view)

Implementation Notes

* This is purely presentation logic; do not store “row number” in the DB
* In React table rendering, use the row map index:

  * render `index + 1` in the first cell

2. Add a Prompt Interface to Add Keywords
   Goal
   Allow me to add new keywords quickly from the SERP dashboard without leaving the page.

UI/UX Requirements

* Add a compact “Add Keywords” prompt input above the table (or in the table header bar)
* Provide two input modes:
  A) Single keyword add (one line)
  B) Bulk paste (multi-line textarea; one keyword per line)
* Provide an “Add” button that:

  * Saves keywords into the canonical target_keywords list (DB)
  * Dedupes against existing keywords (case-insensitive trim)
  * Marks new ones as active
  * Immediately updates the All Keywords table
* After adding:

  * Show a success toast: “Added X keywords (Y duplicates skipped)”
  * Clear the input

Optional (Nice-to-have, but implement if easy)

* Add a small AI prompt button like “Suggest 20 more”

  * Opens a modal that asks ChatGPT for suggestions based on the domain + existing list
  * Shows preview list with checkboxes before importing

Backend Requirements (if not already present)

* Ensure an API exists: POST /api/keywords

  * body: { domain, keywords: string[] }
  * behavior:

    * normalize: trim, lower-case for dedupe comparisons
    * upsert into target_keywords table
    * return updated keyword list (or count + new rows)
* Ensure GET /api/keywords returns the canonical list for the domain

Acceptance Criteria

* All Keywords table has a new # column and rows are numbered 1..N
* I can paste in 10 keywords and click Add; duplicates are skipped and the table updates instantly
* Keywords persist after refresh (saved to DB)
* Page still loads even if SERP worker is down (shows last saved keyword list + last rankings)
