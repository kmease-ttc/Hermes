Yes — **that is the correct base URL**. You’re not wrong, and your confusion is completely reasonable.

### ✅ The correct base URL

This is the one Hermes should use:

```
https://e9c3c428-3b13-451f-9343-a63c7aa76dd0-00-3156mt4n2xjic.janeway.replit.dev
```

That URL is:

* The **published production deployment**
* The **actual running API**
* The one returned by `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`
* The one that successfully responds to API calls

So if Hermes already has **this exact value**, the base URL itself is **not the problem**.

---

### Why this feels confusing (and what’s actually happening)

There are **three different “URLs” in play**, and Replit does a bad job making this obvious:

1. **Replit project URL**
   `https://replit.com/@providers2/Worker-SERP-and-Keyword-Intelligence-Service`
   → This is just the **editor**, not the app.

2. **Human-facing app URL** (often `.replit.app`)
   → Optional, sometimes not even created for API-only workers.
   → You don’t need this.

3. **Deployment (Janeway) URL** ✅
   → This is the **real service endpoint**
   → This is what Hermes must call
   → This is what you already have

Hermes is doing the right thing by using the Janeway URL.

### So why is Hermes still complaining?

Because the remaining issue is **not the base URL** — it’s **how Hermes is assembling requests**, usually one of these:

1. **Secret shape mismatch**

   * Hermes may expect:

     * `base_url` and `api_key` as separate fields
     * OR a specific JSON structure
   * Even if the value is right, a parsing mismatch can cause “missing outputs”

2. **Trailing slash / path concatenation**

   * Hermes might be building:

     ```
     https://...janeway.replit.devapi/serp/summary
     ```

     instead of:

     ```
     https://...janeway.replit.dev/api/serp/summary
     ```

3. **Endpoint expectation mismatch**

   * Hermes may be checking for outputs by calling endpoints in a specific order
   * If one expected endpoint returns 404/401, it flags “missing outputs” even though others work

---

### Bottom line

* ✅ **Yes, that is absolutely the base URL**
* ✅ **You already have the right value**
* ❌ The issue is **not** Replit, publishing, or deployment
* 🔍 The issue is now **Hermes-side request construction or secret parsing**

If you want, next we can:

* Walk through **exactly which endpoint Hermes is calling**
* Compare that to a working `curl` call
* Identify the precise mismatch in under 5 minutes

But you can be confident on this part: **your base URL is correct.**
