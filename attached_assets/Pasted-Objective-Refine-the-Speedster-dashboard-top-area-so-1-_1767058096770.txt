Objective
Refine the Speedster dashboard top area so:

1. “Ask Speedster” is moved up directly under the Speedster header (top info) and above Mission Status.
2. “Run Vitals Scan” + “Export Fix Pack” are consolidated into the top Speedster header actions.
3. Remove duplicate actions: the header “Refresh” button should represent “Run Vitals Scan” (so don’t show both).

Change 1 — Move “Ask Speedster” Up
Current:

* “Ask Speedster” appears below Missions.

Required:

* Reposition “Ask Speedster” to sit immediately under the top Speedster header/info block.
* Final order at top should be:

  1. Speedster Header (name/role/desc/tags + right-side actions)
  2. Ask Speedster prompt widget
  3. Mission Status
  4. Missions
  5. Core Web Vitals cards / rest

Layout rules:

* Keep it compact (single-line input + send icon).
* It should visually feel like part of the “top stack” for Speedster, not a lower section.

Change 2 — Consolidate Actions into Top Speedster Header
Current:

* There’s a Refresh button/icon in the header.
* There are also “Run Vitals Scan” and “Export Fix Pack” buttons elsewhere on the page.

Required:

* Incorporate both actions into the top Speedster header actions area.
* Treat the existing header Refresh button as “Run Vitals Scan”:

  * Either relabel it (tooltip/title) to “Run Vitals Scan”
  * Or keep the icon but update its tooltip and handler to trigger the vitals scan
* Remove the standalone “Run Vitals Scan” button from the body (avoid duplicates).

Export Fix Pack:

* Add a small export icon button in the header actions area (next to Run Vitals Scan).
* Tooltip/title: “Export Fix Pack”
* Clicking it triggers the same existing export behavior.

Do not show Run Scan / Export buttons anywhere else after this change.

Change 3 — Remove Duplicates + Ensure Correct Wiring

* After moving these actions to the header:

  * The body should not include Run Vitals Scan or Export Fix Pack controls.
  * Only the top header actions remain.
* Verify:

  * Run Vitals Scan triggers the same API call as before
  * Export Fix Pack triggers the same export function as before
  * No navigation away from /speedster after actions complete

Acceptance Criteria

* Ask Speedster appears between the Speedster header and Mission Status.
* Top header includes:

  * Run Vitals Scan (using the existing refresh icon/button)
  * Export Fix Pack (small export icon)
* No duplicate scan/export buttons exist in the body.
* All actions still work and stay on the Speedster page.
