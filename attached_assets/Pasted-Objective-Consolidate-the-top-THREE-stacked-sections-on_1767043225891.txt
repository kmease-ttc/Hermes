Objective
Consolidate the top THREE stacked sections on the Natasha dashboard into ONE unified header block. The header should contain the avatar/icon, “Natasha”, “Competitive Intelligence”, the “what she does” sentence, the capability tags/pills, and the right-side controls (Agent Score, Refresh, Settings). Eliminate all repeated/secondary header cards below.

Current Issue
The page shows 3 separate header-like areas:

1. Top row with Natasha + Competitive Intelligence + controls
2. A large “what she does” card with pills
3. A second Natasha identity row/card with more pills and another mini-controls area
   This is redundant and wastes vertical space.

Required End State (Single Header)
Replace the three areas with ONE header component that includes, in this order:
A) Left cluster:

* Back arrow
* Crew avatar/icon (Natasha’s eye icon)
* Title: Natasha
* Subtitle: Competitive Intelligence (small “tag”/chip next to or under the title)
  B) Middle/under-title content:
* One “what she does” sentence (single line or 2 lines max): “Monitors competitors, tracks ranking shifts, and identifies strategic gaps.” (or current preferred copy)
* Capability pills in one row: Competitor Analysis, SERP Recon, Gap Detection
* Optional “Monitors:” label + pills (Competitor Rankings, Share of Voice, Content Gaps, SERP Features) should either:

  * be merged into the same pills row (if you want one set of pills total), OR
  * be a second row under the main pills, but still inside the SAME header block
    C) Right cluster (only once):
* Agent Score badge + progress bar
* Refresh button (calls competitive intel refresh)
* Settings button

Deletion / Consolidation Rules

* Remove the entire second “Natasha / Competitive Intelligence” block below the big card.
* Remove the separate big card container if it only repeats the description and pills; its content must move into the unified header.
* Remove any duplicated “Score” widget/buttons that appear below; there should be only one set of controls in the header.
* Do not render crew name/role/description/pills anywhere else above Mission Status.

Implementation Notes

* Create/standardize `CrewDashboardHeader` to support:

  * `title` (Natasha)
  * `subtitle` (Competitive Intelligence)
  * `subtitleTag` (renders as a small pill/tag next to subtitle, not repeated elsewhere)
  * `description` (what she does)
  * `primaryPills` (Competitor Analysis, SERP Recon, Gap Detection)
  * `secondaryPills` or `monitorsPills` (Competitor Rankings, Share of Voice, Content Gaps, SERP Features)
  * `rightActions` slot (Agent Score + Refresh + Settings)
* Ensure Natasha page uses ONLY this header component and does not additionally render any legacy “agent summary” cards.

Visual Requirements

* Keep existing styling tokens (colors, gradients, typography).
* Tighten vertical spacing: after the unified header, the next section should be Mission Status.
* Pills should be left-aligned under the description and not split across multiple separate containers.

Acceptance Criteria

* The top of the Natasha page shows ONE consolidated header region.
* “Natasha”, “Competitive Intelligence”, the small tag, the “what she does” sentence, and all pills appear only once and are visually grouped.
* There is only one Agent Score / Refresh / Settings control group.
* Scrolling starts sooner; Mission Status is immediately below the header.
