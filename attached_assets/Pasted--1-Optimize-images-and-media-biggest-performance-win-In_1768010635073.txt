	1.	Optimize images and media (biggest performance win)

	•	Inventory every image on the site (home + examples/portfolio + any backgrounds).
	•	Ensure every image is served in WebP/AVIF where supported.
	•	Add responsive image sizing:
	•	Use srcset + sizes for every non-icon image so mobile gets a smaller asset.
	•	Generate at least these widths for key images: 320, 480, 768, 1024, 1440, 1920.
	•	Add lazy-loading for below-the-fold images:
	•	loading=“lazy” on all non-critical images.
	•	Use fetchpriority=“high” only for the single hero/LCP image.
	•	Ensure background images are not oversized:
	•	If using CSS background-image, consider swapping to an  for better srcset control, or implement media-query-based backgrounds.
	•	Add a build-time image optimization step:
	•	Compress aggressively while keeping quality acceptable (target <150KB for most images; hero ideally <250KB).
	•	Validate improvement with Lighthouse/PageSpeed mobile after shipping.

	2.	Remove render-blocking resources (speed up first paint)

	•	Audit all CSS and JS loaded on the homepage.
	•	Ensure non-critical scripts are deferred:
	•	Add defer to all scripts that don’t need to run before initial render.
	•	Use async only if script order doesn’t matter.
	•	Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content (or use framework support for critical CSS extraction).
	•	Remove unused CSS/JS:
	•	Run a coverage report (Chrome DevTools) and remove dead code.
	•	If using a framework bundle:
	•	Enable code splitting for routes (home vs examples page).
	•	Ensure tree-shaking is enabled in production builds.

	3.	Improve accessibility: alt text everywhere it matters

	•	Audit every  and SVG icon usage.
	•	For content images (portfolio screenshots, logo, illustrations):
	•	Add meaningful alt text describing the image.
	•	For decorative images:
	•	Use alt=”” (empty alt) so screen readers skip them.
	•	For SVG icons used as buttons/controls:
	•	Ensure the accessible name is provided via aria-label on the button, not on the SVG.

	4.	Improve accessibility: label the mobile hamburger menu properly

	•	Add aria-label to the mobile menu button:
	•	aria-label=“Open menu” when closed
	•	aria-label=“Close menu” when open
	•	Add aria-expanded to the menu toggle button:
	•	aria-expanded=“false” when closed
	•	aria-expanded=“true” when open
	•	Ensure the menu container has appropriate semantics:
	•	Wrap in  where applicable.
	•	Keyboard behavior:
	•	When menu opens, focus should move to the first menu item.
	•	Escape should close the menu and return focus to the toggle button.
	•	Tab should not focus behind the open menu (trap focus if it’s a modal-style overlay).

	5.	SEO hygiene: add canonical tags per page

	•	Add a self-referencing canonical link tag on every page:
	•	Home: https://arclo.pro/
	•	Examples: https://arclo.pro/examples (or whatever the real path is)
	•	Ensure there is only one preferred URL format:
	•	Pick trailing slash or not, then enforce redirects to the preferred version.
	•	Confirm canonical + redirects match the preferred format.

	6.	Security headers: enable HSTS and baseline hardening

	•	Add Strict-Transport-Security header:
	•	Start with a short max-age in staging, then increase in production.
	•	Recommended final: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload (only if we’re confident all subdomains are HTTPS).
	•	Add additional baseline headers (safe defaults):
	•	X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
	•	Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
	•	X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (or use frame-ancestors in CSP)
	•	Permissions-Policy: restrict as appropriate
	•	Add a Content-Security-Policy (phased rollout):
	•	Start in Report-Only mode to catch violations.
	•	Then enforce with a tight allowlist for scripts/styles/images/fonts.
	•	Confirm zero mixed content in console after changes.

	7.	Broken link monitoring and UX fallback

	•	Add an automated link check in CI:
	•	Crawl internal routes and validate 200/301 responses.
	•	Validate critical external links (portfolio examples, etc.) and flag failures.
	•	Improve the 404 page:
	•	Add a clear “Back to home” CTA.
	•	Include links to the most important pages (Home, Examples, Pricing/Contact if present).
	•	Keep styling consistent with the rest of the site.
	•	Add monitoring:
	•	Track 404 hits in analytics so we can see if users or bots are hitting dead URLs.

	8.	Strengthen CTAs and conversion flow

	•	Make the primary CTA consistent across sections:
	•	Same label, same styling, same destination.
	•	Add a sticky header CTA on scroll (desktop + mobile), if it fits the design.
	•	Ensure CTA destinations are clear:
	•	If it’s “Get Started,” it should go to a signup flow or a contact/demo form.
	•	Add a secondary CTA for users not ready to convert:
	•	e.g., “See Examples” or “How it Works” section jump.

	9.	Add trust signals (high impact on conversion)

	•	Add a testimonials section:
	•	1–3 short quotes with name + business type (even if anonymous at first).
	•	Add lightweight proof points:
	•	Number of sites generated, time-to-launch, or measurable results if available.
	•	Add a simple “About” footer snippet:
	•	Short line about who Arclo is for and what it does.

	10.	Add a “How it Works” + FAQ section (content depth + SEO)

	•	Add a “How it Works” section with 3–5 steps:
	•	Audit → Build → Keyword strategy → Publish → Ongoing optimization
	•	Add an FAQ block:
	•	What industries does Arclo support?
	•	Can I edit the site?
	•	How long does setup take?
	•	What does “autonomous SEO” do daily/weekly?
	•	Pricing / trial / cancellation
	•	If we later want rich results:
	•	Implement FAQ schema (JSON-LD) once content is stable.

	11.	Content quality guardrails (keep it clean as it grows)

	•	Run a grammar/spell check as part of PR review (or CI).
	•	Keep copy consistent:
	•	Maintain the same voice and terminology across pages.
	•	Avoid vague claims:
	•	Where possible, use concrete statements (timeframes, deliverables, outputs).

	12.	Final QA checklist before shipping

	•	Test on:
	•	Desktop (Chrome, Safari), mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), tablet.
	•	Run Lighthouse in production mode:
	•	Track: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO.
	•	Validate:
	•	No console errors
	•	No layout shifts on load
	•	No keyboard traps
	•	No missing meta titles/descriptions
	•	Canonicals correct
	•	Security headers present
	•	Document the results in the PR and attach before/after Lighthouse screenshots.
