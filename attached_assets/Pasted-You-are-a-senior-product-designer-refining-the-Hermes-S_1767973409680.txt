You are a senior product designer refining the Hermes SEO dashboard UI.

Problem:
The “Ready to fix” card correctly uses the Hermes brand (violet → pink → amber gradient, premium styling), but the other three summary cards (“Technical issues found”, “Keyword opportunities found”, “Competitor gaps found”) still use generic semantic colors (red, green, yellow). This creates a visual mismatch and makes the UI feel inconsistent and unfinished.

Goal:
Bring all four cards into a **single, cohesive brand system** derived from the Hermes logo. The cards should feel like variations of the same component, not four different design languages.

Design Direction:

* Hermes branding (violet → pink → amber) is the primary visual language.
* Semantic colors (red, green, yellow) should NOT dominate the cards.
* Status meaning should be conveyed through subtle accents and iconography, not background color blocks.
* The “Ready to fix” card is the reference standard — all other cards should visually belong to the same family.

Instructions:

1. Card Backgrounds

* Replace solid red/green/yellow backgrounds with a **neutral, premium surface**:

  * Background: white or very light gradient (white → slate-50)
  * Border: subtle slate border OR faint brand-gradient stroke
* All four cards should share the same base background treatment.

2. Brand Accent Application

* Introduce Hermes brand color via:

  * Icon container (preferred)
  * Thin top border or left accent line
  * Very subtle gradient glow on hover
* Do NOT use full-card semantic color fills.

3. Icon Styling (Critical)

* Each card icon should live inside a **brand-tinted circular badge**:

  * Background: soft gradient using Hermes colors at low opacity
    (violet/pink/amber at ~10–15%)
  * Icon color: slate-900 or white depending on contrast
* Icons communicate category; color communicates brand.

4. Status Differentiation (Subtle)

* Status meaning should be secondary:

  * “Issues” → warning icon shape, not red background
  * “Opportunities” → target icon, not green fill
  * “Gaps” → comparison icon, not yellow fill
* If needed, add a small colored dot or label, but keep the card itself brand-neutral.

5. Typography Consistency

* Numbers: large, bold, slate-950
* Labels: slate-700
* Secondary text: slate-500
* Match font weight and spacing used in “Ready to fix”.

6. Hover & Interaction

* On hover:

  * Slight lift (translateY -2px)
  * Soft shadow increase
  * Very subtle brand-gradient glow
* All cards should animate identically.

Acceptance Criteria:

* All four cards feel like the same component system.
* Brand identity is immediately recognizable across every card.
* “Ready to fix” no longer feels like the only premium element.
* The dashboard reads as intentional, cohesive, and brand-led.

Reference:
Use the existing “Ready to fix” card as the canonical example for spacing, depth, and brand application. Update the other three cards to match that level of polish without duplicating its exact content.

End result:
A dashboard where brand consistency reinforces trust and the entire UI feels designed — not assembled.
