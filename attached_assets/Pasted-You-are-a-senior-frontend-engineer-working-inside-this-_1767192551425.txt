You are a senior frontend engineer working inside this Replit project.

Goal
Make EVERY crew member page use the exact same “Speedster-style” top header + ask bar pattern (name, category pill, one-line description, capability tags, score, refresh/export/settings icons, and the “Ask <CrewName> …” input). Right now it’s inconsistent: some crews have it, but others (example: Scotty) do not. Fix this permanently so new crews can’t drift.

Non-negotiables

* Do not hand-edit each crew page to “copy/paste” a header. Create/normalize a single shared component and use it everywhere.
* After the change, Scotty (and all others) must show the same header shell as Speedster at the top of the page.
* The header must render even if the crew has no data (“No findings yet” etc. is fine). No missing header due to empty state.

Steps (do these in order)

1. Inventory all crew pages

* Search the repo for crew pages and routes. Look for:

  * routes with “/crew/”, “/agents/”, “/serp/”, “/content/”, “/technical/”, etc.
  * pages under client/src/pages/** that correspond to each crew member (Speedster, Sentinel, Hemingway, Beacon, Natasha, Pulse, Socrates, SERP, Scotty, etc.)
* Output a list of every crew page file you found and the route it maps to.

2. Identify the gold-standard implementation

* Locate the Speedster page and the component(s) responsible for its header.
* Identify the shared shell component if it exists (e.g., CrewDashboardShell / CrewHeader).
* Confirm where the crew metadata comes from (name, subtitle/category, description, capabilities/tags, score, header actions, ask placeholder).

3. Create a single canonical component if one doesn’t already exist

* If there is NOT already a single canonical reusable header/shell used by every crew, create:

  * client/src/components/crew/CrewDashboardShell.tsx (or keep existing if already present)
  * client/src/components/crew/CrewHeader.tsx (if separate makes sense)
* This canonical component must implement the full Speedster header pattern:

  * Avatar/icon
  * H1 name
  * Category pill
  * One-line description
  * Capability tags (3–6)
  * Agent score display
  * Icon buttons: Refresh, Export, Settings (export can be disabled if no data)
  * “Ask <CrewName>” prompt bar with crew-scoped placeholder
* It must accept props like:

  * crewId / crewKey
  * metadata (name, category, description, tags)
  * score
  * actions (onRefresh, onExport, onSettings)
  * ask prompt config (placeholder, onSubmit)
  * enabled/not-hired state (if already supported)
* It must render even if data is empty.

4. Centralize crew metadata in ONE place

* Create or update a single registry file:

  * client/src/crew/crewRegistry.ts (or similar)
* It should define, for every crew:

  * id
  * name
  * category/subtitle
  * description
  * capabilityTags
  * askPlaceholder
  * default routes
* Ensure Scotty is included in this registry.

5. Refactor every crew page to use the canonical shell
   For EACH crew page file from Step 1:

* Replace any bespoke header/title markup with:

  * <CrewDashboardShell crewId="..." ... />
* The page should only supply:

  * crewId
  * the inner content widgets (findings, next steps, etc.)
  * any action handlers unique to that crew (refresh/export/settings)
* No page should render its own header once this is done.

6. Fix Scotty specifically

* Ensure Scotty’s page imports and uses the canonical shell.
* Ensure Scotty’s metadata exists in the registry (name “Scotty”, category “Technical SEO”, description, tags).
* Verify it renders the same header and ask bar as Speedster.

7. Prevent future drift

* Add a lintable or structural rule:

  * If a page is a “crew page”, it must use CrewDashboardShell.
* Practical approach:

  * Keep all crew pages under a single folder (e.g., client/src/pages/crew/*)
  * Ensure routing points all crew routes to a single CrewPage component that reads crewId from params and loads the correct inner widgets, if feasible.
* If a full route unification is too big, at least ensure all existing crew pages use the shell now.

8. Verification checklist (must do before finishing)

* Run the app and visually check at minimum:

  * Speedster
  * Sentinel
  * Hemingway
  * Beacon
  * Natasha
  * Pulse
  * Socrates
  * SERP
  * Scotty
* Confirm each has:

  * Name, category pill, description, tags
  * Score + refresh/export/settings icons
  * Ask bar
* Confirm header appears even with “no data yet”.

Deliverables

* List of all crew pages found + which were modified
* The new/updated canonical shell/header component(s)
* The central crew registry file including Scotty
* Confirmation that Scotty now matches Speedster’s header pattern
