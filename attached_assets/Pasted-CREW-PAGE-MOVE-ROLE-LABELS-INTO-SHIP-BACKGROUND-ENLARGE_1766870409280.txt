CREW PAGE – MOVE ROLE LABELS INTO SHIP BACKGROUND + ENLARGE CREW AVATARS

Context:
The ship layout is working, but crew tiles are visually cramped because each tile contains BOTH the role and the crew info. We need to remove role labels from the crew tiles and place role names directly on the ship background.

Goal:
- Role labels live on the ship (background layer)
- Crew tiles show ONLY the bot avatar + status badge
- Bots appear larger and more visually prominent
- Empty slots still communicate the role clearly

This is a layout + semantics change only. Do NOT change functionality.

---

### 1) ROLE LABELS MOVE TO SHIP (BACKGROUND LAYER)

For each role slot:
- Remove role text from the crew tile entirely
- Render the role name as part of the ship background layer
- Role label should be:
  - Small, subtle text
  - Positioned near or slightly above the empty bay
  - Use muted text color (text-muted)
  - Example: “Competitive Intelligence”, “SERP Tracking”, “AI Optimization”

Implementation:
- Add a `roleLabel` overlay positioned relative to the ship container
- These labels are NOT clickable
- They do not move when a crew member is added

Empty slot state:
- Show role icon (eye, graph, lightning, AI glyph, etc.)
- Show info “i” icon
- Show role name (background label)
- Crew tile is NOT rendered

Filled slot state:
- Hide role icon
- Keep role name on background
- Render crew tile centered in that bay

### 2) CREW TILES: BOT-ONLY VISUALS

Update crew tile content:

Remove:
- Role name text
- Role subtitle text

Keep:
- Bot avatar (centered)
- Status badge (Active / Included / Selected)
- Gold outline when active

Bot avatar sizing:
- Increase avatar size by ~20–30%
- Target:
  - Avatar fills ~60–70% of tile height
- Tile itself can stay square, but bot should dominate visually

Result:
- Bots look larger, clearer, and more “alive”
- No text crowding inside tiles

---

### 3) MAJOR TOM (MISSION CONTROL)

Major Tom special rules:
- Role label “Mission Control” should appear on the ship background near the cockpit
- Crew tile shows:
  - Bot avatar
  - Badge: Included
- Major Tom tile may be slightly larger OR have a unique badge/icon
- Do NOT show “Mission Control” inside the tile

---

### 4) EMPTY SLOT VISUALS

For empty slots:
- Render NO crew tile
- Render a subtle empty bay placeholder:
  - Dashed outline
  - Role icon centered
  - Info icon in corner
- Role name is visible via the background label

Hover behavior:
- Highlight the bay outline
- Tooltip: “Assign a crew member to this role”

Click behavior:
- Opens crew selection modal for that role

---

### 5) WHAT NOT TO CHANGE

- Do NOT change slot positions
- Do NOT change click behavior
- Do NOT change modal logic
- Do NOT move Mission Status or lower sections
- Do NOT add new roles

---

### 6) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete when:
- Role labels are no longer inside crew tiles
- Role labels are clearly readable on the ship background
- Crew bots appear noticeably larger
- Empty slots are understandable without crew present
- Visual density is reduced and the ship feels more spacious
