You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **Mission Control dashboard**. The **Tasks section is functionally correct but emotionally flat**. Users see tasks, but they do **not feel compelled to click** or understand the **value of completing each task**.

Your job is to refactor the Tasks section so it becomes:

* Obvious
* Actionable
* Motivating
* Value-driven

This is a **UX + layout + copy refactor only**. Do not change backend task logic.

## CORE PROBLEM TO SOLVE

Right now Tasks answer:

> “Here are things the system can do.”

They must instead answer:

> **“What should I do next, and why does it matter?”**

If a user doesn’t feel a pull to click **Fix it**, the task is not framed correctly.

---

## NEW TASKS MENTAL MODEL (LOCK THIS IN)

Tasks should be treated as **recommended actions**, not a list.

Each task must communicate:

1. What will happen
2. Why it matters (business impact)
3. How hard/risky it is (reassurance)

---

## LAYOUT CHANGE: MAKE TASKS BIGGER & CLEARER

### A) Promote “Next Action” into a PRIMARY TASK CARD

At the top of the Tasks section:

Replace the small “Next: Complete Fetch Analytics” line with a **large featured task card**.

#### Featured Task Card (1 only)

Must include:

* Task title (large)
* Clear value statement (one sentence)
* Expected outcome (metrics unlocked or risk reduced)
* Primary CTA (Fix It)

Example:

**Fetch Analytics Data**
“Unlock traffic, conversion, and engagement insights so Arclo can prioritize the right fixes.”

Small subtext:

> Unlocks traffic trends, conversion rate, and lead tracking

CTA:

> Fix This Now

This card should visually stand out from the rest.

---

### B) Secondary Tasks = Action Cards (not rows)

Replace the current flat list rows with **stacked action cards**.

Each task card must include:

#### Required fields

* **Task title**
* **Why this matters** (business-facing, not technical)
* **What improves** (metrics, tasks unlocked, protection gained)
* CTA button (consistent placement)

#### Example transformation

❌ Current:
**Check Indexing Status**
Verify which pages are indexed and identify indexing issues

✅ New:
**Fix Indexing Issues**
“Ensure your pages can appear in Google search results and prevent silent traffic loss.”

Subtext:

> Confirms indexing for key pages and detects hidden errors

CTA:

> Fix This

---

## COPY RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Never lead with system actions

Avoid phrases like:

* Fetch
* Collect
* Verify
* Gather

Instead, reframe as outcomes:

* Unlock analytics
* Protect rankings
* Improve visibility
* Prevent traffic loss

---

## TASK VALUE TEMPLATE (USE THIS FOR EVERY TASK)

Each task must follow this copy structure:

**Title:** Outcome-oriented
**Description:** Why it matters to the business
**Impact line (small):** What improves or unlocks
**CTA:** Fix This / Fix Now

If you cannot explain the value in one sentence, the task copy is wrong.

---

## VISUAL DESIGN RULES FOR TASKS

* Tasks section keeps **yellow/gold glow** (attention)
* Featured task:

  * Slightly larger card
  * Stronger glow
* Secondary tasks:

  * Equal-height cards
  * Same CTA alignment
* Buttons:

  * Use **secondary accent** (not green)
  * Green only appears AFTER completion

---

## OPTIONAL BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

### Add a section header explainer

Under “Tasks” title, add a small line:

> “Recommended actions to improve traffic, rankings, and conversions.”

This frames the entire section correctly.

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

* Do NOT show raw system language
* Do NOT show long technical descriptions
* Do NOT hide value behind tooltips
* Do NOT leave tasks visually small or secondary

Tasks are the **engine of value delivery** — treat them as such.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before finishing, verify:

* One featured “Next Action” card exists
* All tasks explain **why they matter**
* All task CTAs feel worth clicking
* A non-technical user can answer:

  > “What happens if I click this?”
* The Tasks section feels as important as Key Metrics

If Tasks still feel like a to-do list instead of recommendations, keep refining.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **People don’t act on tasks. They act on outcomes.**

Make every task feel like progress toward something they care about.
