Replit Prompt: Use Mission Control Page Background as Global App Background

Goal
Standardize the application’s background so the **Mission Control page background color becomes the default background color for the entire site**. This is a visual consistency update only.

Context
The Mission Control page currently has a soft, modern background color that feels correct for the product. Other pages still use slightly different background shades, which breaks visual cohesion.

Requirements

* Identify the exact background color (or gradient, if applicable) used on the Mission Control page container.
* Promote this color to be the **global app background**.
* All primary pages should inherit this background automatically:

  * Mission Control
  * Agents
  * Crew
  * Integrations
  * Settings
* Individual cards, panels, and modals should remain white or near-white and continue to visually “float” on top of the background.

Implementation details

1. Extract the Mission Control background color into a single design token:

   * Example: `--app-bg` or `theme.background.default`
2. Apply this token at the root layout level:

   * The main app wrapper (`<body>` or root layout container)
3. Remove page-specific background overrides that conflict with this value.
4. Ensure scrolling areas, side nav, and empty states all sit on the same background color.
5. Do NOT change:

   * Card backgrounds
   * Recommendation panels
   * Agent cards
   * Modal/dialog backgrounds

Guardrails

* No gradients unless the Mission Control background already uses one.
* No color changes to text, borders, or status chips.
* Maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility.
* Dark mode (if present) should remain unaffected.

Acceptance criteria

* The entire app uses the same background color as Mission Control.
* There are no visible background color jumps when navigating between pages.
* Cards and panels retain clear contrast against the background.
* The UI feels calmer and more cohesive overall.

This is a consistency and polish task, not a redesign.

If you want, next I can:

* Help you extract the **exact hex/RGB value** from the Mission Control page
* Or define a light/dark token pair so this scales cleanly later
