Perfect call. You’re right — the names should telegraph function instantly, and the cultural references should reinforce what the worker actually does, not distract from it. Let’s tighten this up.

Below is a clean, on-the-nose revision of the crew names you flagged, plus a small update prompt you can hand to Replica to adjust the manifest without re-architecting anything.

Updated Crew Naming Decisions

1. Marketing / Ads Worker

Old issue: Banker-ish / finance vibes
Goal: Growth, persuasion, messaging, conversion

Recommended name: Madison
Role: Growth Strategist
Why it works:
	•	Clear reference to Madison Avenue (advertising, copy, campaigns)
	•	Neutral, professional, instantly “marketing”
	•	Scales well as ads get more complex (search, display, retargeting, CRO)

Color: Hot Pink or Magenta
Icon: Megaphone or TrendingUp

If you want a slightly sharper tone:
	•	Alternate: Sterling (ad agencies, not finance)
	•	Alternate: Banner (very literal, very clear)

Madison is the cleanest.

2. Writer / Content Generator

You were spot-on here.

Name: Hemingway
Role: Editorial Craftsman
Why it works:
	•	Immediately implies clarity, restraint, strong writing
	•	Fits SEO + long-form + rewriting
	•	Cultural shorthand for “good writing, no fluff”

Color: Deep Sea Blue
Icon: PenTool or BookOpen

This is a perfect match for:
	•	Blog writing
	•	Rewrites
	•	Knowledge base articles
	•	Tone normalization

This one feels premium.

3. Competitive Intelligence Worker

Old issue: Generic / bland
Goal: Spycraft, recon, stealth, competitors

You’re right that spy names work extremely well here — but we should avoid anything too jokey or geopolitical.

Best options:

Primary recommendation: Natasha
Role: Intelligence Operative
Why it works:
	•	Instantly reads as “spy”
	•	Short, memorable
	•	Neutral enough to feel intentional, not silly

Alternates (if you want different vibes):
	•	Boris – heavier, brute-force recon
	•	Cipher – modern, technical spy
	•	Shadow – more abstract, less human

Natasha is the sweet spot.

Color: Crimson or Dark Red
Icon: Eye or Crosshair

Replica Update Prompt (Focused, Safe Change)

Use this verbatim with Replica:

Update the existing Crew Manifest configuration only (do not refactor architecture).

Changes required:
	•	Rename the marketing/ads worker to:
	•	Nickname: Madison
	•	Role: Growth Strategist
	•	Color: #EC4899
	•	Icon: Megaphone
	•	Rename the writer/content worker to:
	•	Nickname: Hemingway
	•	Role: Editorial Craftsman
	•	Color: #1E3A8A
	•	Icon: PenTool
	•	Rename the competitive intelligence worker to:
	•	Nickname: Natasha
	•	Role: Intelligence Operative
	•	Color: #7F1D1D
	•	Icon: Eye

Preserve all service_id values, APIs, and logic. This is a presentation-only update.

Why This Now Works
	•	Every name instantly implies function
	•	Cultural references reinforce behavior, not personality
	•	No name feels silly in logs, dashboards, or investor demos
	•	The system still scales cleanly as you add more workers

If you want, next we can:
	•	Do a full tone pass to ensure none of the remaining names drift
	•	Add log message templates per crew member (“Natasha flagged 3 threats”)
	•	Define naming rules for future workers so this never degrades

This is turning into a real product personality — the good kind.
