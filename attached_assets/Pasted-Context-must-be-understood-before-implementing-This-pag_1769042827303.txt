Context (must be understood before implementing)

This page is the FIRST page a user sees immediately after:

* Visiting the website
* Entering their email
* Submitting their domain

They have NOT:

* Purchased a plan
* Connected Google Analytics
* Configured integrations
* Chosen agents or modules

This is a first-run “proof of value” page.

Primary Goal

Convince the user — within 30–60 seconds — that:

1. Arclo ran a real analysis on their site
2. The data shown is credible
3. There is clear upside being left on the table
4. Arclo already knows what to do next
5. Upgrading will unlock execution, not discovery

This page is NOT:

* A configuration screen
* A fake demo
* A generic SEO checklist
* An internal dashboard

Core Principle

This page should feel like:
“I just got a real SEO report, for free, in under a minute.”

Not:
“Here’s a product UI I need to learn.”

Data Inputs (first-run safe)

Only use data that can be obtained without user configuration:

* SERP intelligence
* Public competitor rankings
* Keyword data
* Site crawl / page inspection
* Heuristic modeling (clearly labeled)

Do NOT require GA, GSC, or paid APIs for the initial experience.

Page Narrative (must follow this order)

Snapshot → Proof → Opportunity → Action → Upsell

Page Structure

A) Header (trust + orientation)

* “SEO Performance Report”
* “Generated for {domain}”
* Timestamp
* Location (if inferred)
* Small line: “Based on live search and competitor analysis”

This reassures users this is real.

B) Top Metrics (immediate proof)
Show only metrics that feel intuitive to non-experts:

* Keywords tracked
* Keywords in Top 20
* Keywords not ranking (100+)
* Optional: Authority (only if confidently inferred)

Optional projection callouts (clearly labeled “Estimated”):

* Traffic at risk
* Clicks lost
* Leads missed

Projection notes:

* These are modeled estimates
* Not required to reconcile 1:1 with rankings
* Must be labeled as projections

C) Current Wins vs Big Gaps (credibility moment)

Current Wins

* 5–10 keywords ranking well
* Show keyword, volume, rank

Big Gaps

* 5–10 high-intent keywords not ranking
* Show keyword, volume
* Show which competitor ranks top 3

This section answers:
“Why am I not winning what I should be winning?”

D) What Arclo Would Do Next (most important section)

This is NOT a feature list.
This is a prescriptive plan.

Generate 3–5 sections max:

1. Push Near-Wins

* Pages ranking 4–20
* Exact actions Arclo would take:

  * Optimize title/meta
  * Add internal links
  * Expand content
  * Add FAQs

2. Create Missing Pages

* Pages competitors have that the site does not
* Show:

  * Page name
  * Primary keyword + volume
  * Proposed slug
  * Why it matters

3. Publish With Momentum

* Blog topics Arclo would publish
* Each includes:

  * Title
  * Keyword + volume
  * Which service page it supports

4. Authority / Technical (only as locked previews)

* If not purchased:

  * Show 1–2 concrete examples
  * Clearly label as “Unlocked with upgrade”
  * No placeholder or fake bullets

E) Keyword Table (proof + depth)

This is the source of truth.

Columns:

* Keyword
* Volume
* Current rank
* 7d / 30d delta
* Target page (existing or “Create page”)
* Primary competitor

Everything above must be derived from this table.

Design & UX Rules (first-run specific)

* No “Unlock everything” walls
* No fake examples
* No internal jargon (missions, runs, agents)
* Locked sections should feel like:
  “You’re seeing the preview — execution unlocks next”

Tone:

* Calm
* Confident
* Executive
* Helpful

Deliverable

A first-run SEO report page that:

* Feels real
* Feels valuable
* Feels immediately useful
* Naturally leads the user to upgrade to execute the plan Arclo already prepared
