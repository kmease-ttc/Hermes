You are a senior frontend engineer working inside this Replit project.

Goal
Stub out a **“Recently Completed”** section inside the Mission widget UI only.
Do **NOT** implement behavior, persistence, cooldowns, or server logic yet. This is purely a **visual + structural change** so we can lock the layout before wiring behavior.

Scope (important)

* This applies to **crew pages first** (e.g., Socrates, Speedster, etc.).
* Do NOT touch backend logic.
* Do NOT change mission execution behavior yet.
* Do NOT remove or refactor existing “Next Actions”.
* This is a **UI stub only**.

What to build

1. Add a new section under “Next Actions”
   Inside the existing Missions / Mission Overview widget:

* Keep the current structure:

  * Title
  * Status pill
  * “Next:” line
  * **NEXT ACTIONS** section (unchanged)
* Directly **below Next Actions**, add:

Header:

* Label: **RECENTLY COMPLETED**
* Same typography, casing, spacing, and divider style as **NEXT ACTIONS**

2. Visual parity with Next Actions
   The **Recently Completed** section must:

* Look **identical** to Next Actions in layout and styling
* Use the same list item/card component as Next Actions
* Same left icon alignment
* Same spacing
* Same right-side button area (but see below)

3. Stub content (hardcoded / temporary)
   For now, render a single stub item:

* Title: “Review and categorize findings”
* Subtext: “Completed just now” (or “Completed 2m ago” — static text is fine)
* Right-side:

  * NO “Fix it” button
  * Instead show a small green checkmark icon or a “Completed” pill (visual only)

If there are zero completed items:

* Show a muted empty state text:

  * “No completed actions yet”

4. Reuse existing components

* Do NOT create a totally new card style.
* Reuse:

  * the same Mission list item component used by Next Actions
  * the same container styles
* The only differences:

  * Section header text (“RECENTLY COMPLETED”)
  * Right-side control (Completed indicator instead of Fix it)

5. Keep it visually contained

* Recently Completed should clearly read as part of the **same Mission widget**, not a separate card.
* No new background panels.
* No new accent colors yet.
* Keep it neutral and consistent.

6. Where to implement

* Update the shared Mission widget / MissionOverview component (whatever is currently used across crew pages).
* Do NOT implement this only for Socrates — make it available for all crews automatically.

Acceptance criteria

* Crew pages show:

  * NEXT ACTIONS
  * RECENTLY COMPLETED (below it)
* Both sections look visually identical.
* Recently Completed is clearly non-interactive.
* No mission behavior has changed yet.
* No backend changes.

After this
Once the stub is in and the layout feels right, we’ll:

* Wire it to real completion data
* Enforce cooldowns
* Move items from Next Actions → Recently Completed properly

For now, **just get the UI structure in place cleanly**.
