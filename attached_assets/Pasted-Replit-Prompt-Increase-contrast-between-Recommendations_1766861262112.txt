Replit Prompt: Increase contrast between Recommendations panel background and inner cards

Problem
In the Recommendations section, the panel background and the inner recommendation cards are too visually similar. This makes the hierarchy hard to follow.

Goal
Create clear visual separation between:

1. the overall page background
2. the Recommendations container panel
3. the individual recommendation cards

Requirements

* Do not change the content or layout structure (keep 2-column grid for items 1–2 and full width for item 3).
* Only adjust styling: background colors, borders, shadows, spacing, and section dividers.
* Keep the existing chips and “Review →” CTA.

Changes to implement

1. Recommendations container panel styling

* Add a subtle header band at the top of the panel (behind “Recommendations” title row only).
* Give the panel a slightly different background from the page:

  * Example: panel uses a faint blue/gray tint (very light), while page remains white.
* Add a subtle border (1px) around the panel and a soft shadow.

2. Inner recommendation cards styling

* Make each inner recommendation card background true white (or near-white).
* Increase card border contrast slightly (still subtle).
* Add a slightly stronger shadow than the panel (so cards feel “above” it).
* Increase spacing between cards (gap 16–20px).

3. Priority Actions header separation

* Add a thin divider line under “PRIORITY ACTIONS” to separate the header from the cards.
* Optionally add a small left accent rule for each card tied to its priority color.

4. Blockers section separation

* Make Blockers feel like its own sub-card:

  * Slightly stronger tinted background than the panel body
  * Clear border + padding
  * Maintain current warning icon style

Acceptance criteria

* The Recommendations panel reads as a distinct container.
* The inner cards visually pop and are easy to scan independently.
* The hierarchy is obvious at a glance: Panel > Cards > Blockers.
* No new UI elements; no functional changes.

Implementation notes

* Apply these changes where the Recommendations panel component is defined (likely a single component file).
* Prefer utility classes (Tailwind) consistent with the rest of the project.
