Replit Prompt: Make Mission Control Match the “My Crew” Visual Language

Objective
The **My Crew** page has the right visual language: dark, confident, cohesive, and premium. The **Mission Control** page currently feels visually disconnected (lighter cards, weaker hierarchy, inconsistent depth). Update Mission Control so it **feels like it belongs to the same product family as My Crew**.

This is a **visual alignment + polish task**, not a functional rewrite.

---

## Core Design Goal

Mission Control should feel like:

* The **command deck** of the same ship
* A sibling to **My Crew**, not a different app
* Dark, focused, confident, and intentional

If someone flipped between the two pages, they should immediately feel:

> “Yes, this is the same system.”

---

## 1. Global Background + Depth

Use the **exact same background treatment** as My Crew:

* Dark gradient background
* Subtle vignette
* Soft noise / texture if present
* No flat gray or light backgrounds

Implementation:

* Apply the My Crew background styles to the Mission Control root container.
* Remove any light page backgrounds or default white canvas styles.

Result:

* Mission Control sits *inside* the ship, not on top of a webpage.

---

## 2. Card System: Match My Crew’s “Glass + Depth” Style

All Mission Control cards (Recommendations, Metrics, Agent summaries) should adopt the **My Crew card language**:

### Card styling rules

* Dark translucent backgrounds (glass effect)
* Soft inner glow or subtle border
* Stronger shadow depth (cards feel embedded, not floating)
* Rounded corners consistent with crew tiles

Remove:

* Flat white cards
* Light gray card backgrounds
* Thin, low-contrast borders

---

## 3. Typography Alignment

Match My Crew typography hierarchy:

### Headings

* Slightly larger
* Higher contrast
* Tighter line height
* More confident weight (medium → semibold)

### Body text

* Muted, but readable
* Less “UI gray”, more intentional tone
* Increase spacing between sections instead of relying on lines

### Chips / badges

* Rounded
* Softer fills
* Integrated into cards (not floating pills)

---

## 4. Recommendations Section (Critical)

The Recommendations panel should feel like a **mission briefing**, not a checklist.

### Changes to make:

* Remove the light container background.
* Turn the Recommendations section into a **dark briefing panel**:

  * Header band
  * Inner cards styled like crew tiles
* Increase contrast between:

  * Section background
  * Individual recommendation cards

Each recommendation card should:

* Use the same depth + glow treatment as crew member tiles
* Feel “clickable” and important
* Use color sparingly for priority, not for structure

Rename:

* “Recommendations” stays (already fixed)
* Remove any remaining “Captain” language

---

## 5. Key Metrics Cards → Mission Instruments

The Key Metrics cards should feel like **ship instruments**, not analytics widgets.

### Update them to:

* Dark translucent card background
* Larger numbers
* Stronger accent color tied to status
* D3 sparkline stays, but:

  * Subtle glow
  * Proper padding
  * No hard edges

Use:

* Green = healthy
* Amber = watch
* Red = alert
  (all pulled from the same palette used in My Crew)

---

## 6. Agent Summary → Mini Crew Tiles

Replace any flat “agent summary” rows with **mini versions of the My Crew tiles**:

Each agent summary card should include:

* Avatar
* Name
* Role
* Status badge
* Score / progress bar

They should feel like:

> “This is a crew member working on this mission.”

---

## 7. Buttons & CTAs

Match My Crew button style:

* Rounded
* Slight glow or depth
* Clear hover/active states
* No flat text links for primary actions

Update:

* Review →
* Export
* Run Diagnostics

So they feel like ship controls, not web links.

---

## 8. Remove Anything That Feels “Webby”

Audit and remove:

* Flat white containers
* Default table styles
* Light gray dividers
* Overuse of borders

Replace with:

* Spacing
* Depth
* Subtle gradients
* Visual grouping

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Mission Control is done when:

* It visually feels like the **same environment** as My Crew
* Cards feel embedded in the ship, not pasted on top
* The user feels like they are operating a system, not reading a report
* Switching between My Crew and Mission Control feels seamless

---

## Guardrails

* Do NOT change functionality
* Do NOT add new UI elements
* Do NOT lighten the page
* Prefer depth and contrast over color
* Subtle > flashy

---

## Deliverable

* Updated MissionControl.tsx styling
* Shared card styles reused from My Crew where possible
* No duplicated one-off styles

---

This task is about **cohesion, confidence, and atmosphere**, not features.
