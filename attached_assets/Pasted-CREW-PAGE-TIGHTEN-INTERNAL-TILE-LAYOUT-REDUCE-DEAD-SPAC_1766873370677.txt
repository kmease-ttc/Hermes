CREW PAGE – TIGHTEN INTERNAL TILE LAYOUT (REDUCE DEAD SPACE)

Context:
The bot avatar size is PERFECT. Do NOT resize or scale the avatar.
The problem is excessive internal padding and vertical spacing between:
- info (“i”) icon
- Active badge
- avatar
- name text

Goal:
Dramatically reduce internal margins so the tile feels compact, dense, and intentional, while keeping the avatar dominant.

---

### 1) DO NOT CHANGE
- Avatar image size
- Tile outer dimensions
- Tile corner radius
- Border thickness
- Hover / click behavior

This is an INTERNAL LAYOUT ONLY change.

---

### 2) TILE INTERNAL GRID (MUST IMPLEMENT)

Re-structure each tile’s content into 3 tight zones:

ZONE A – Top Overlay (VERY SMALL)
- Height: minimal (icon + badge only)
- Contains:
  - Top-left: info “i” icon
  - Top-right: Active / Included / Selected badge
- Padding:
  - Top: 6–8px
  - Left/Right: 8–10px
- Icons/badges must NOT push content down

This zone should feel like an overlay, not a block.

---

ZONE B – AVATAR ZONE (PRIMARY)
- Avatar remains centered
- Reduce vertical margin above and below avatar
- Avatar should visually sit closer to the name
- No extra spacer divs above avatar

Rule:
- The avatar zone should start immediately under the top overlay
- Remove any `margin-top` or `padding-top` greater than ~8px

---

ZONE C – NAME ZONE (BOTTOM, TIGHT)
- Crew name must be:
  - Larger
  - Closer to avatar
- Reduce margin between avatar and name to ~6–8px
- Remove any large bottom padding

Typography:
- Name font size: increase ~20–25%
- Font weight: semibold
- Line-height: tight (1.1–1.2)
- Color: text-primary

The name should feel “attached” to the avatar, not floating far below it.

---

### 3) REMOVE EXCESS SPACING (IMPORTANT)

Explicitly remove or reduce:
- Large `padding-top` on tile container
- Spacer divs between avatar and name
- Any `margin-bottom` on avatar container > 8px
- Any `padding-bottom` on tile container > 10px

If space is needed:
- Steal it from padding, not avatar scale.

---

### 4) EMPTY SLOT TILES (MATCH DENSITY)

Apply the SAME tight spacing rules to empty role slots:
- Role icon sits higher
- Role name sits closer to icon
- Info icon + role icon do not create large gaps

Empty slots must feel as dense as filled slots.

---

### 5) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete when:
- Avatar remains the same size
- Name is noticeably closer to the avatar
- Info icon and Active badge feel tucked into corners
- No large dead space above or below the avatar
- Tile feels compact and visually balanced

If you have to choose between shrinking the badge or shrinking the avatar:
→ Shrink the badge. Never the avatar.
