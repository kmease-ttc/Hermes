Let’s Do Step 1 (Now)

Below is a precise execution plan you (or Replit Agent) can follow immediately.

Step 1.1 — Rename the Page

Change

Route: /crew

Page title: Crew Manifest → Agents

Subtitle:

Your hired specialists analyzing and improving your site

Why
This instantly reframes the page from “internal system” to “value to me.”

Step 1.2 — Define the Canonical User-Visible Agent List

These are the only agents that should render on the Agents page:

✅ Keep (End-User Value)

Scotty — Technical SEO

Beacon — Domain Authority & Backlinks

Pulse — GA4

Lookout — SERP Analyst

Natasha — Competitive Intelligence

BlogWriter — Content + Quality (merged)

Speedster — Performance / Core Web Vitals

Sentinel — Content Decay Monitor

Draper — Google Ads

Socrates — Knowledge Base

❌ Hide (Infrastructure / Internal)

Vault

Herald (Notifications)

Auth / Secrets / Telemetry

Any “connector-only” services

Rule
If the agent does not find, analyze, or recommend something actionable → it does not render.

Step 1.3 — Implement the Filter (Code-Level)

Add a flag to your agent/service definition (or infer by role):

is_user_visible: true | false


Then filter before rendering:

const visibleAgents = agents.filter(a => a.is_user_visible);


If you don’t want a new field, fallback logic works too:

const HIDDEN_ROLES = [
  "Vault",
  "Notifications",
  "Secrets",
  "Telemetry",
  "Auth"
];

const visibleAgents = agents.filter(
  a => !HIDDEN_ROLES.includes(a.role)
);

Step 1.4 — Normalize Naming (Important)

Make names explicit and outcome-based:

Old	New
Writer	BlogWriter
Quality Auditor	Merged into BlogWriter
Growth Strategist	Draper – Google Ads
SEO Librarian	Socrates – Knowledge Base
Systems Engineer	Scotty – Technical SEO
Telemetry Officer	Pulse – GA4

No codenames without a plain-English role.

Step 1.5 — Temporary Card Layout (Minimal, for Now)

Before redesigning cards in Step 2, simplify what exists:

Each card should show only:

Agent Name

Role

Health status

Last seen timestamp

Hide for now:

Capability chips

Internal connector IDs

Technical jargon tags

This keeps Step 1 focused and low-risk.

What You’ll Have After Step 1

Page renamed to Agents

Only useful agents visible

Clean mental model for users

Zero behavior changes to workers

Ready foundation for Step 2 (card intelligence)
