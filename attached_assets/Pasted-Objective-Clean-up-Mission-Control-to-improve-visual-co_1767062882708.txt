Objective
Clean up **Mission Control** to improve visual consistency, reduce noise, and clarify primary actions. This is a **typography + UX consolidation pass**, using the existing “Critical” styling as the baseline.

---

Typography System (Primary Fix)

Use the **“Critical” red label** as the typographic anchor for the entire dashboard.

Rules:

* Font family used by “Critical” becomes the base font for:

  * Section headers
  * Status labels
  * KPI titles
* Font size hierarchy should be normalized relative to that baseline:

  * Status words (Critical / Needs attention / Healthy): largest + bold
  * Section titles (Mission Status, Missions, Blockers): medium
  * Card titles: slightly smaller
  * Descriptions / helper text: smaller, muted

Do NOT mix multiple font sizes for the same semantic role.
No random size jumps between cards.

---

Mission Actions Cleanup

1. Mission cards

* Replace **“Review”** with **“Fix it”**
* Clicking “Fix it” should immediately open the confirmation dialog
* No intermediate “review” step

2. Mission Status

* Remove **“Go to next mission”** entirely
* Mission Status should only show:

  * Overall status (Critical / Needs attention / Healthy)
  * Summary text
  * ONE primary action

3. Fix Everything

* There must be **only one “Fix Everything” button**
* Color: **yellow** (consistent everywhere)
* Location: **Mission Status only**
* Remove any other instances across the page

---

Blockers Improvements

* Keep the Blockers section (it works well)
* Each blocker must include a **direct link** to where it can be resolved:

  * Example:

    * “Google Ads not connected” → link to **Integrations page**
* Do not force users to hunt for the fix location

---

Key Metrics (Conversion / Bounce / Sessions)

Issue:

* Chart images are stretched and visually distorted

Fix:

* Constrain chart containers to a fixed aspect ratio
* Use `object-fit: contain` (or equivalent)
* Ensure charts never stretch vertically to fill cards
* Cards should feel balanced, not tall and awkward

---

Homepage Content Cleanup

1. Industry Benchmarks

* Remove Industry Benchmarks from the **homepage**
* Benchmarks belong on detailed crew pages, not Mission Control

2. Knowledge Base Section

* Rename section header to **“Socrates”**
* Remove wording like:

  * “Memory”
  * “Knowledge Base Insights”
* This section should display:

  * Actual learned insights
  * Summaries
  * Patterns detected
* Content should feel like:

  * “Here’s what the system has learned about your site”

No empty or placeholder language.

---

Final Structural Rules for Mission Control

* Mission Status = single source of truth for:

  * Overall health
  * Primary action
* Missions = approve/fix items one by one
* Blockers = hard stops with clear fix links
* Metrics = clean, readable, not distorted
* Typography = consistent, calm, intentional

---

Acceptance Criteria

* Font sizes feel consistent and purposeful
* “Critical” styling clearly influences the rest of the UI
* Only one Fix Everything button exists (yellow, in Mission Status)
* No “Review” or “Go to next mission” text remains
* Blockers link directly to where they can be fixed
* Charts are no longer stretched
* Homepage feels lighter, clearer, and more focused

---

This pass is about **polish, restraint, and hierarchy**, not adding features.
