You’re right — thank you for calling that out. The previous prompt was **product-logic complete** but **UX-incomplete**. What you want now is a **single authoritative agent prompt** that tells Replit to:

* rebuild the Dashboard / homepage from scratch
* match the *report / infographic* visual language
* switch to a **light theme**
* rename Crew → Agents everywhere
* implement **locked / unlockable cards**
* align copy, hierarchy, and layout to *ranking-first intent*
* reuse your existing component + HTML system (not invent new UI paradigms)

Below is that prompt. This is the one you give the Replit agent and let it run.

---

### ✅ **FINAL REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — FULL HOMEPAGE REBUILD**

You are a senior product engineer + UX designer working inside the Hermes SEO codebase.

Your task is to **rebuild the Dashboard homepage from scratch** to match the visual language, structure, and intent of the existing SEO Performance Report (infographic-style report).

This is NOT a point fix. This is a full page redesign and rewrite.

---

## PRIMARY GOAL

The Dashboard must feel like:

* a **live SEO performance report**
* ranking-first, prescriptive, and executive
* visually aligned with the existing **SEO Performance Report** UI
* light theme
* focused on rankings, movement, and what to do next
* monetized via **locked / unlockable capability cards**

This page should replace the current “Mission Control” concept entirely.

---

## REQUIRED GLOBAL CHANGES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. Rename concepts

* **Mission Control → Dashboard**
* **Crew → Agents**
* Update labels, routes, copy, components, and references everywhere.

Do not keep legacy wording.

---

### 2. Switch to LIGHT THEME

* Make light theme the default for the Dashboard.
* Match the report aesthetic:

  * white / light backgrounds
  * soft gradient headers
  * pastel stat cards
  * clean dividers
* Dark theme support can remain later, but Dashboard defaults to light.

Do NOT introduce a new design system.
Reuse existing theme tokens and card components where possible.

---

## DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (BUILD EXACTLY THIS)

### SECTION 1 — HEADER (REPORT-STYLE)

Above the fold.

* Title: **SEO Performance Overview**
* Subtitle: “Updated weekly · Focused on rankings that drive demand”
* Small “Weekly Report” pill or badge (visual only)

Stat cards (reuse report-style KPI tiles):

* Keywords tracked
* Ranking in top 20
* Improved this week
* Declined this week

This section must visually resemble the SEO report header.

---

### SECTION 2 — RANKING MOMENTUM (7-DAY CHANGE)

Styled like the existing “Rankings Over Time” panel.

Two columns:

* **Improving**
* **Needs Attention**

Each item shows:

* keyword
* rank movement (+ / −)
* current position

Filter out noise. Only meaningful movers appear.

---

### SECTION 3 — WHAT TO DO NEXT (CORE VALUE)

This is the most important section.

Use **prescriptive, numbered steps** exactly like the roadmap infographic language.

Include these four blocks:

1. **Strengthen pages close to page one**
2. **Build pages for high-volume gaps**
3. **Fix technical issues that limit rankings**
4. **Publish with momentum (weekly plan)**

Each block must include:

* short explanation (“What this means”)
* bullet actions
* a **Status row**:

  * Active
  * Unlock [Agent Name]
  * Finish setup

This section replaces “Fix Everything”.

---

### SECTION 4 — PAGES TO OPTIMIZE

Card list.

Each item shows:

* page name
* keyword + volume + rank
* prescriptive action (“Rewrite title…”, “Add internal links…”)

Match wording style already coming from the SERP engine.

---

### SECTION 5 — TOP PERFORMERS

Green-tinted success card.

List:

* top-performing pages
* keyword
* rank

Add subtle copy:

> “These pages protect your traffic. Changes here should be deliberate.”

---

### SECTION 6 — AGENTS (UNLOCKABLE CAPABILITIES)

This replaces Crew.

Each Agent is a **locked or unlocked card**.

Required agents:

* Technical SEO
* Analytics Insights
* Content Optimization
* Content Automation

Each agent card must include:

* short outcome-based description
* “Includes” bullet list
* Locked state (blur / overlay)
* CTA button:

  * **Subscribe**
  * **Upgrade Plan**
  * **Finish Setup**

No “Fix Now” language anywhere.

---

### SECTION 7 — HOW THIS WORKS (FOOTER EXPLANATION)

Short, calm, confidence-building.

Steps:

1. Rankings tracked weekly
2. Meaningful movement detected
3. Prescriptive actions generated
4. Automation unlocked where useful

End with:

> Rankings are the signal. Everything here exists to improve them.

---

## UX + COPY RULES

* Do NOT invent metaphors.
* Do NOT gamify.
* Do NOT show vanity metrics.
* Everything should feel:

  * analytical
  * confident
  * calm
  * prescriptive

This should feel like:

> “An SEO report that updates itself.”

---

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

* Reuse existing card, grid, and typography components.
* Do NOT create a new layout system.
* Prefer composition over refactors.
* Keep data bindings intact (placeholders are fine).
* Build locked states using existing subscription flags.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is done when:

* Dashboard visually matches the SEO Performance Report style
* Light theme is default
* Mission Control and Crew are fully removed
* Agents replace Crew everywhere
* Homepage communicates:

  * rankings
  * movement
  * next actions
  * unlockable automation
* No “Fix Everything” UI remains

---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

Proceed in this order:

1. Rename concepts (Mission Control → Dashboard, Crew → Agents)
2. Switch Dashboard to light theme
3. Rebuild layout top-to-bottom per structure above
4. Align copy to report language
5. Implement locked agent cards
6. Verify no legacy language remains

Do not stop early. This is a full rebuild.

Begin now.

---

If you want, next we can:

1. Tighten **visual microcopy + empty states**
2. Map **subscription tiers → agent unlock rules**
3. Rewrite the **public marketing homepage** to mirror this Dashboard
4. Produce a **Figma-ready layout spec** from this structure

Just tell me the number.
