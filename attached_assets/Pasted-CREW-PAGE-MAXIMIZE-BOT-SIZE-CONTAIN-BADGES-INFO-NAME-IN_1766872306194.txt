CREW PAGE – MAXIMIZE BOT SIZE + CONTAIN BADGES/INFO/NAME INSIDE FRAME (LAYOUT ONLY)

Context:
Ship layout is correct. This change is ONLY about sizing and internal tile layout.
We want the robot characters (avatars) to be as large as possible while still keeping the Active badge, info icon, and name INSIDE each frame.

Non-negotiable goals:
1) The bot avatar should be the dominant element in every tile (as big as possible).
2) The tile frame must contain:
   - Active/Included badge
   - Info (“i”) icon
   - Name (or empty slot label)
3) No overlap between tiles.

---

### 1) TILE SIZE + RESPONSIVE SCALE
Increase the base tile size and make it responsive:
- Tile width/height: clamp(160px, 16vw, 220px) on desktop
- Empty role slots must be the SAME size as filled slots
- Major Tom may be up to 10–15% larger, but keep consistency

---

### 2) INTERNAL TILE LAYOUT (MUST FOLLOW)
Inside each tile, reserve only small “chrome” areas and give the rest to the avatar:

Tile layout regions:
A) Top bar (overlay, inside frame):
- Top-left: Info “i” icon (small)
- Top-right: Active/Included/Selected badge (small)
- These must NOT overlap the avatar

B) Avatar region (main area):
- Avatar must occupy at least 70% of the tile height
- Use object-contain but scale aggressively
- Avatar should be centered

C) Name label (inside frame, bottom):
- Name text is INSIDE the frame, bottom center
- Single line (truncate if needed)
- No name text outside the frame

Rules:
- Do NOT place name below the tile.
- Do NOT allow badge or info icon to cover the avatar.
- If space is tight, shrink the badge text, NOT the avatar.

---

### 3) AVATAR SIZE REQUIREMENT (THE KEY PART)
Make avatars as big as possible:
- Target avatar size: 72–84% of tile height
- Example implementation: set a fixed avatar container inside the tile that is:
  height: 75% of tile
  width: 90% of tile
- Reduce padding around the avatar dramatically
- The avatar is the hero; chrome is secondary

---

### 4) EMPTY SLOT TILES
Empty role tiles must still contain:
- Role icon (centered, large)
- Info icon (top-left)
- Role name (bottom, inside frame)
- “Empty slot” as muted small text if needed (optional, inside frame only)

---

### 5) SPACING / NON-OVERLAP
Because tiles are larger, update x/y positions to prevent overlap:
- Minimum spacing:
  - horizontal gap >= 32px
  - vertical gap >= 44px
- Tiles must not overlap at >= 1280px width
- It is OK for the ship section to be taller and scrollable; do NOT compress tiles to fit.

---

### 6) WHAT NOT TO CHANGE
- Do NOT change roles list
- Do NOT change click behavior / modal behavior
- Do NOT change mission status or lower sections
- Do NOT change theme colors

---

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Bots appear significantly larger and are the dominant element in each tile
- Badge, info icon, and name are all INSIDE the frame
- No text sits below/outside the tile
- No overlap between tiles
- Empty slots match filled slot size and look intentional
