Replit Prompt: Make “My Crew” the Global Design System (Gold + Purple Accents), Without Breaking Key Metrics

Objective
The “My Crew” page has the best visual language in the product: premium, cohesive, space-themed, and readable. The rest of the app (Mission Control, Integrations, Agents, etc.) has drifted into mixed styles (some sections feel “Christmassy” and inconsistent). Make the **My Crew styling the canonical design system** for the entire app.

Important: Do NOT redesign everything. Standardize the core primitives (background, panels, chips, buttons, typography) so every page feels like My Crew.

Key exception:

* Keep the “Key Metrics” cards styling exactly as it is (they look great). Do not restyle those cards except to ensure surrounding backgrounds/padding match.

---

## 1) Establish the Canonical Theme Tokens (Single Source of Truth)

Create a single shared theme file (CSS variables or Tailwind tokens) sourced from the My Crew page:

A) Background

* Use the My Crew blue “space” gradient as the global app background.
* Keep the subtle vignette and depth.
* Remove flat black canvases across the app.

B) Surfaces / Panels (My Crew glass)
Define these tokens:

* `surface.panel` (main section containers)
* `surface.card` (cards inside panels)
* `surface.cardActive`
* `surface.cardDisabled`
* `surface.cardHighlightGold` (the gold-accented ones)
* `surface.borderSubtle`
* `surface.shadowSoft`
* `surface.glowSubtle`

C) Accent Colors (avoid “Christmassy”)
Primary accents:

* Gold (existing)
* Purple (new secondary accent — lighter shade for variation)

Rules:

* Gold = “featured / included / primary highlight”
* Purple = “secondary action / interactive focus / primary CTA alternate”
* Green/Red remain semantic only (success/error) but should be toned down and used sparingly.

---

## 2) Standardize the Visual Primitives Across the App

Update shared components so every page uses the same primitives as My Crew:

A) Panels

* All major sections should use the same “My Crew panel” styling:

  * dark translucent background
  * subtle border
  * inner glow
  * consistent radius/shadow

B) Cards

* Use My Crew card treatment everywhere EXCEPT Key Metrics:

  * active/available card = normal glass
  * disabled card = grayed-out (muted opacity, dashed border)
  * highlighted card = gold-accent border/glow
* Keep the “grayed out / gold highlight / normal” patterns intact and re-usable.

C) Chips / Badges

* Reuse the filled-glass chip style from My Crew:

  * translucent bg + solid text color
* Ensure chip colors do not create a red/green holiday vibe:

  * reserve red/green only for alert/good statuses
  * use gold/purple for product states and actions

D) Buttons
Create button variants modeled on My Crew:

* Primary: Purple gradient CTA (for “Run Diagnostics”, “Approve”, “Run QA”)
* Secondary: Gold CTA (for “Add crew” style actions)
* Tertiary: dark glass button (for “Review”, “Refresh”, “Export Prompt”)
  Buttons must share:
* same height, radius, padding
* consistent hover lift + glow
* no mismatched purple styles between pages

---

## 3) Page-by-Page Alignment (Scope)

A) Mission Control

* Keep Key Metrics section unchanged.
* Everything else (Recommendations, Action Queue, Crew Summary, Benchmarks, Knowledge Base) must use My Crew panels + card styling.
* Crew Summary cards should be re-skinned to match My Crew crew tiles:

  * same glass, highlight, disabled states
  * gold/purple accents as appropriate
* Reduce “Christmas” feel by removing mixed saturated red/green accents where they aren’t semantic.

B) Integrations

* Apply My Crew panel + card styling.
* Use the same purple gradient for primary buttons.
* Ensure statuses use toned semantic chips, not neon.

C) Agents Page

* Convert agent cards to match My Crew card language:

  * subtle glass
  * colored accents used sparingly (agent color for progress/score only)
  * tooltips and badges match chip system

D) Sites/Settings/Other pages

* Apply global background + panel primitives.
* Replace any remaining flat/white sections with the My Crew surface tokens.

---

## 4) Protect What Already Works (Do Not Touch)

Do NOT change:

* Key Metrics cards styling
* Sparkline charts styling
* Their color logic

Only ensure the surrounding container and spacing uses the My Crew theme.

---

## 5) Acceptance Criteria

* The entire app feels like My Crew (same space gradient, same panel/card language).
* Gold and Purple are the primary accent system used across pages (variation without chaos).
* Disabled/active/highlight card states are consistent and reusable everywhere.
* Mission Control no longer feels like a patchwork of styles.
* Key Metrics stays exactly as it is and still looks great.
* No “Christmassy” vibe: red/green only appear for true semantic Good/Alert states.

Deliverables

* Central theme tokens (background, surfaces, borders, shadows, accents)
* Shared UI primitives updated (Panel, Card, Chip, Button)
* Mission Control / Integrations / Agents updated to use these primitives
* Key Metrics untouched

If you want the fastest implementation path: start by extracting My Crew panel/card/button classes into shared components, then swap Mission Control (excluding Key Metrics), then Integrations, then Agents.
