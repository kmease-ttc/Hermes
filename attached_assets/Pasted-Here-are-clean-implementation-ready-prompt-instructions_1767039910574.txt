Here are clean, implementation-ready **prompt instructions** you can paste directly into Replit / your agent to consolidate the top section and remove the redundancy.

---

### UI Consolidation Instructions — Natasha Dashboard Header

**Objective**
Consolidate the duplicated Natasha header sections into a single, clean, non-repetitive header component.

---

### Problem Summary

The Natasha dashboard currently renders **two stacked header sections** that repeat the same information:

* Agent name (“Natasha”)
* Role (“Competitive Intelligence”)
* Description text
* Capability / monitor pills

This creates visual redundancy and wastes vertical space.

---

### Desired Outcome

There should be **one unified header** at the top of the page that contains all relevant information exactly once.

---

### Required Changes

1. **Create a Single Header Component**

   * Combine all header content into one component (e.g. `CrewDashboardHeader`).
   * This component should render only once per crew dashboard.

2. **What the Unified Header Should Include**

   * Agent icon
   * Agent name: *Natasha*
   * Role: *Competitive Intelligence*
   * Short description (single sentence)
   * Capability / monitor pills (e.g. Competitor Analysis, SERP Recon, Gap Detection)
   * Right-aligned controls:

     * Agent Score
     * Refresh button
     * Settings icon

3. **What to Remove**

   * Remove the second duplicated Natasha block entirely.
   * Remove any repeated description text or repeated pills.
   * There should not be two headings, two descriptions, or two pill rows.

4. **Layout Rules**

   * Header should visually match the style of Mission Control headers.
   * Pills appear once, directly under the description.
   * No nested cards that restate the agent identity.
   * Vertical spacing should be reduced so KPIs appear higher on the page.

5. **Data & Logic**

   * Use a single source of truth for:

     * Agent name
     * Description
     * Capabilities
   * Do not hardcode duplicates in multiple components.
   * Other crew dashboards should reuse this same header pattern.

6. **Acceptance Criteria**

   * Page renders with exactly one Natasha identity section.
   * No repeated text or pills.
   * Refresh button still triggers the same data reload behavior.
   * Visual hierarchy is clear: Header → Status → Missions → KPIs → Inspector.

---

### Non-Goals

* Do not change styling tokens or color palette.
* Do not change business logic or API calls.
* This is a structural cleanup, not a redesign.

---

If you want, next we can:

* Turn this into a reusable `CrewHeaderSchema`
* Apply the same consolidation across **all crew dashboards** in one pass
* Or tighten the copy in the header to be more action-oriented
