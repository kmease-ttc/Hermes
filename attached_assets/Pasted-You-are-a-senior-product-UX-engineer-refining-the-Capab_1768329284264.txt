You are a senior product + UX engineer refining the **Capabilities & Performance** section. The crew + metrics collapse is correct, but the cards have lost their **core KPI gravity**.

Your task is to re-introduce a **large, central KPI per capability card** so each card immediately communicates value, impact, or status at a glance.

This is a **visual hierarchy fix**, not a data model change.

---

## CORE PROBLEM

Each capability card currently shows:

* Crew name
* Status
* Trend
* Tasks

But **no dominant metric**.

As a result:

* The cards feel informational, not performance-driven
* The user can’t quickly answer “how is this doing?”

---

## CORE DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

**Every capability card must have ONE primary KPI rendered in the center of the card**, visually similar to the old Key Metrics cards.

This KPI is the **hero element** of the card.

---

## KPI PLACEMENT & HIERARCHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Card vertical structure (top → bottom)

1. **Header**

   * Crew avatar
   * Crew name + subtitle
   * Status badge (Active / Locked / Setup)

2. **PRIMARY KPI (NEW – MUST BE VISUAL FOCAL POINT)**

   * Large number or score
   * Strong color (crew color)
   * Centered horizontally
   * This should be the biggest text in the card

3. **KPI label**

   * Smaller text below the number
   * Explains what the number represents

4. **Trend indicator**

   * ↑ Improving / → Stable / ↓ Needs attention
   * Subtle, secondary

5. **Task count**

   * “X tasks open” or “All caught up”

6. **CTA**

   * Review / Configure / Enable

---

## KPI VISUAL RULES

* Font size: **significantly larger** than any other text in the card
* Weight: bold
* Color:

  * Use the **crew’s brand color**
* Opacity:

  * Full opacity for active
  * Slightly muted for locked/sample

The KPI should be visible **without reading any other text**.

---

## REQUIRED CORE KPIs (DO NOT DEVIATE)

Use these exact primary KPIs unless data is unavailable:

* **Scotty (Technical SEO)**
  KPI: *Completion Rate* OR *Pages with Issues*

* **Speedster (Performance)**
  KPI: *Performance Score* OR *Worst LCP*

* **Sentinel (Content Decay)**
  KPI: *Pages Losing Traffic*

* **Hemingway (Content Strategy)**
  KPI: *Content Quality Score*

* **Atlas (AI Optimization)**
  KPI: *Optimization Score*

* **Draper (Paid Ads)**
  KPI: *Conversions* OR *CPA* (locked until setup)

* **Socrates (Knowledge Base)**
  KPI: *Insights Generated*

* **Popular (Analytics)**
  KPI: *Monthly Sessions* (sample)

* **Lookout (SERP Tracking)**
  KPI: *Keywords Tracked* (sample)

* **Beacon (Domain Authority)**
  KPI: *Domain Authority* (sample)

* **Natasha (Competitive Intel)**
  KPI: *Competitors Tracked* (sample)

If a KPI is unavailable:

* Show a sample value
* Label clearly as “Sample”
* Keep the same visual hierarchy

---

## LOCKED / SAMPLE STATE HANDLING

Locked cards must:

* Still show the large KPI
* Use blurred/muted styling
* Show “Sample” badge
* Include CTA: “Enable”

Do NOT remove the KPI just because it’s locked.

---

## FINAL VISUAL CHECK

After implementing, the user should be able to:

* Scan the grid in **3–5 seconds**
* Instantly see:

  * What’s working
  * What’s not
  * Where value is coming from

If the eye does not land on a big number in the middle of each card, it’s wrong.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before finishing, confirm:

* Every capability card has a large central KPI
* KPI uses crew color and dominates the card visually
* Trend + tasks feel secondary
* Locked cards still show KPIs (sampled)
* Cards now feel like **performance dashboards**, not status summaries

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Cards without a hero metric don’t feel valuable.**

Bring back the KPI gravity — that’s what made the old metrics work.
