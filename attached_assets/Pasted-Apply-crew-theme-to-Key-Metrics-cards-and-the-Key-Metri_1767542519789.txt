Apply crew theme to Key Metrics cards (and the Key Metrics container) on every crew page. For Popular specifically, the Key Metrics cards must inherit Popular’s teal theme (border/glow/badges/icons), not the neutral default.

What “themed Key Metrics” means (definition)
On a crew page, the Key Metrics section should visually look “owned” by that crew:

* Container header accents use crew color (underline/pill/badge)
* Each metric card uses:

  * crew-colored border/ring (subtle)
  * crew-colored icon accent / badge
  * optional crew glow on hover
* Severity/status pills and small sparklines use crew color
* No hardcoded colors per page; everything comes from CrewTheme tokens

Implementation approach (do it once, works everywhere)

1. Ensure CrewPageLayout provides theme tokens

* Every crew page must be wrapped in <CrewPageLayout crewId="popular"> (already planned).
* CrewPageLayout sets CSS variables on a root container, e.g.:
  --crew-primary
  --crew-ring
  --crew-bg-subtle
  --crew-text
  --crew-badge

2. Update Key Metrics components to consume theme automatically
   Find the component(s) used to render the Key Metrics grid/row (e.g., MetricCard, KpiCard, KeyMetricsRow).
   Change them so they reference the theme variables rather than neutral styling.

Example styling rules (conceptual)

* Card default:
  border: 1px solid var(--crew-ring) at low opacity
  background: var(--card-bg) (keep dark)
* Hover/focus:
  box-shadow/glow: var(--crew-primary) at low opacity
* Badge/pill:
  border/text uses var(--crew-primary)
* Icon accent:
  icon color uses var(--crew-primary)

3. Do not hardcode teal on Popular page

* Popular should “be teal” because crewId=popular and the theme tokens are teal.
* This prevents future regressions when components change.

4. Make it consistent across all crews
   Once Key Metrics consumes theme vars:

* Lookout metrics become Lookout color automatically
* Natasha metrics become Natasha purple automatically
* Scotty metrics become Scotty orange automatically

5. Acceptance criteria

* On /crew/popular, Key Metrics cards have visible teal-themed borders/pills/icons consistent with Popular’s header theme.
* On /crew/lookout, Key Metrics cards switch to Lookout’s theme.
* No per-page CSS overrides required.
* If a crew lacks a theme token, dev mode throws a clear error (no silent fallback to neutral).

Quick patch (if you want immediate improvement before the full token system)
If theme vars already exist but Key Metrics isn’t using them:

* Add a class to the Key Metrics container: className="crew-themed"
* In the shared component CSS/Tailwind:
  .crew-themed .metric-card { border-color: var(--crew-ring); }
  .crew-themed .metric-icon { color: var(--crew-primary); }
  …but the preferred approach is to update the metric card component itself so it always respects theme vars.

Deliverable

* One PR that:

  1. ensures CrewPageLayout sets theme CSS vars for all crew pages
  2. updates Key Metrics card components to use theme vars
  3. validates Popular Key Metrics visually match Popular teal theme (and a second crew as proof)
