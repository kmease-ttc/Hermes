Update scoring + missions semantics (final): Missions = how many tasks you need to do. Score = how well you’re doing in that category. Make them visually distinct everywhere, and ensure the “mission symbol” always appears anywhere missions exist.

1. Definitions (single source of truth)
   A) Missions

* Missions = count of actionable items that require attention for a given scope.
* Displayed as: OPEN MISSIONS (pending + blocked + needs_setup + error)
* Optional secondary: total missions (including completed) shown as “open / total”.

B) Score

* Score = a 0–100 rating for that crew/category (health/performance/compliance).
* Must be computed consistently across the app (dashboard + crew page + mission control).
* Score should never be replaced by mission count.

2. Data model (API contract)
   Every crew status response must include BOTH:

CrewStatus:
{
crewId,
score: { value: number|null, status: "ok"|"unknown", updatedAt },
missions: { open: number, total: number, completedThisWeek: number },
primaryMetric: {...},
readiness: {...}
}

Rules:

* If score cannot be computed: score.value = null and show “—” with a tooltip “Not enough data yet”.
* Missions.open must always be present (0 is valid).

3. UI rules (what shows where)
   A) Dashboard Crew Summary card

* Show Score as the main number (top-right pill)
* Show Missions as a secondary indicator using the mission icon + count

  * Example: 🎯 5 (or whatever mission icon you’re using)
* If missions.open > 0: show mission icon in an “active” state (highlighted)
* If missions.open == 0: show mission icon muted

B) Crew page header

* Score pill remains “Score 58” (or “Score —”)
* Missions indicator appears next to it: mission icon + open count

C) Missions panel on a crew page

* Gold circle = missions.open (NOT score)
* The header text “X missions” = missions.open (same source)

D) Mission Control page

* Gold circle at top = total open missions across all crews (sum of missions.open across crews)
* Each mission line item shows its crew icon + crew color + mission icon

4. “Mission symbol” rule (your requirement)
   Any time missions exist anywhere, the mission symbol must appear.
   Implementation:

* Create a single reusable component: <MissionBadge open={n} />

  * always renders the mission icon
  * renders the number
  * applies crew theme accents if provided
    Use this component in:
* dashboard crew cards
* crew header
* missions widget header
* mission control summary

No page should hand-roll mission UI.

5. Fix existing regressions caused by the earlier semantic change
   It looks like we started swapping score to be missions.pending. Revert that:

* CrewStatusService should compute:

  * score.value using the scoring formula (0–100)
  * missions.open using mission state counts
* Ensure no endpoint overwrites score.value with missions.open.

6. Tooltips + copy (to prevent confusion)

* Score pill tooltip: “Score measures how healthy this area is (0–100).”
* Missions badge tooltip: “Open missions are tasks you need to complete.”

7. Acceptance criteria

* Score and Missions are both visible on:

  * Dashboard Crew Summary cards
  * Each crew page header
  * Missions panel
* Gold mission circle always matches missions.open (crew page) and sum(open) (mission control).
* Score remains a stable rating and does not change just because missions were created.
* The mission icon appears anywhere an open mission count is shown (no exceptions).

Deliverable

* One PR that:

  1. restores Score as 0–100 rating in CrewStatusService
  2. adds missions.open everywhere via shared <MissionBadge />
  3. updates dashboard + crew headers + mission widgets to show both score and missions
  4. adds one regression test: score != missions.open unless by coincidence, and both fields exist in API response
