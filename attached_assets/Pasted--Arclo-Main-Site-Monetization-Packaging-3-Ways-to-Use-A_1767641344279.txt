# Arclo Main Site – Monetization + Packaging + “3 Ways to Use Arclo” Implementation Instructions
Audience: Web Dev Team (Replit)
Goal: Extend the existing marketing wrapper + free report funnel with (1) a paid conversion path, (2) the “3 ways to use Arclo” packaging, (3) add-ons (crew) upsell surfaces, and (4) optional “website build / managed hosting” lead capture.

This document is additive to the earlier spec you already received. Implement everything below on the main Arclo site.

---

## 0) Success Criteria (Definition of Done)
Work is complete when:
1. Users can run a free scan, view a preview, and view a full report.
2. Users are presented a “Next Steps” decision point with three options:
   - DIY Instructions (free)
   - Arclo Core Autopilot (subscription; credit card)
   - Arclo Managed Site (lead capture; not checkout)
3. Arclo Core can be purchased directly in-product (Stripe) via a modal/checkout flow.
4. Paid users can click “Deploy Fixes” and trigger a deploy workflow (v1 can enqueue tasks; must confirm success).
5. Add-ons are surfaced contextually (after Core is active) and can be enabled/paid for.
6. Post-purchase users see an “Autopilot is on” state and receive a monthly summary placeholder.
7. Analytics events exist for every funnel step + purchase.

---

## 1) Core Packaging & Product Model
Externally, do NOT expose internal crew names/services (Hermes, etc.). Use customer-friendly packaging:

### Free: Diagnostic Mode
- Free scan + report and recommendations
- Manual implementation guidance

### Paid: Arclo Core (Autopilot)
- Continuous monitoring + diagnosis + safe deployment
- Subscription per site

### Service: Arclo Managed Site
- “We build / host / manage your site” lead form
- Optionally includes Arclo Core for X months (copy-only for now)

### Add-ons (post-Core)
- Content Growth (content drafts + QA)
- Competitive Intelligence (competitor tracking)
- Authority Signals (backlink monitoring)
(These are bundles; avoid listing every worker service.)

---

## 2) Where “Pricing” Appears (Timing)
IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT show pricing on the homepage hero.
- Pricing appears when a user demonstrates intent:
  1) On “Next Steps” screen after full report, OR
  2) When they click “Deploy Fixes” (recommended best moment)

Implementation rule:
- “Deploy Fixes” triggers a modal that offers:
  - Manual Mode (Free) — “Send instructions to my dev team / download”
  - Autopilot (Paid) — “Turn on Arclo Core”

---

## 3) New Screens / Components to Implement

### A) Full Report Page Enhancements (`/report/:scanId`)
Add these sections:

#### 1) Estimated Impact panel (Cost of Inaction)
Display a simple panel estimating:
- Missed organic traffic (monthly)
- Estimated lost leads
- Optional revenue range
If exact computation isn’t available v1, use:
- A heuristic based on impressions/clicks deltas (if GSC exists)
- Otherwise show “Potential impact” with ranges and note “estimates”

Example UI fields:
- `monthlyTrafficOpportunity`
- `estimatedLeadsRange`
- `estimatedRevenueRange`

#### 2) “Deploy Fixes” primary CTA
Button: **Deploy Fixes**
- If user is NOT subscribed to Arclo Core: open “Deploy Options” modal (see below)
- If user IS subscribed: open deploy confirmation with selection options

---

### B) Deploy Options Modal (Core Conversion UI)
Trigger: Click “Deploy Fixes” when user is not subscribed

Modal title: “How would you like to move forward?”

Display 3 option cards (2 primary CTAs + 1 lead CTA):

#### Card 1: DIY (Free)
Label: “DIY”
Price: “Free”
Bullets:
- View prioritized fixes

Action:
- Open intake form modal OR route to `/managed-site` form (preferred route)
- Submit creates a lead in DB and sends email notification

Notes:
- Keep modal simple. No long text. No crew list.

Event tracking:
- `deploy_options_modal_viewed`
- `deploy_option_selected` with `{ option: "diy" | "autopilot" | "managed_site" }`

---

### C) Next Steps Screen (Alternative Entry)
Route: `/next-steps/:scanId` (optional but recommended)
Shown after user has viewed full report at least once OR after preview gating signup.

This screen mirrors the modal choices but in full page format.
CTA on report page can also be “Next steps” near the bottom.

---

### D) Managed Site Intake Page (`/managed-site`)
A simple lead capture form with:
- Website URL
- Business name
- Industry
- Location (city/state)
- Email
- Phone (optional)
- “What do you want?” dropdown:
  - New site
  - Rebuild
  - Hosting + ongoing management
- Notes textarea

Submission:
- `POST /api/leads/managed-site`
- Save to DB with timestamp + scanId (if available)
- Send notification email to internal inbox
- Thank you state: “We’ll reach out within 1 business day” (copy only; no promises required by system)

Event tracking:
- `managed_site_viewed`
- `managed_site_submitted`

---

## 4) Manual Mode: “Instructions for Your Web Developer”
On the full report page, create a section called:
- “Implementation Plan (DIY)”

Requirements:
- For each prioritized fix, show:
  - Summary of issue
  - Why it matters
  - Steps to implement
  - Risk level
  - Where to apply (page/template)
  - Acceptance criteria

If structured instructions do not exist yet:
- Generate them server-side from findings with a deterministic template.
- Keep it concise.

Optional:
- “Copy all instructions” button
- “Download PDF” button (can use print stylesheet v1)

Event tracking:
- `manual_instructions_viewed`
- `manual_instructions_copied`
- `manual_instructions_downloaded`

---

## 5) Payments: Stripe Subscription for Arclo Core
### Model
- Subscription per site (website_id)
- Store subscription status on `website_id`
- Arclo Core enables:
  - scheduled runs
  - deploy endpoint access
  - notifications + monthly summary

### Stripe Implementation
Backend:
- `POST /api/billing/checkout-session`
Payload:
- `{ website_id, plan: "core" }`
Response:
- `{ checkoutUrl }`

Frontend:
- On “Turn on Autopilot”, call checkout endpoint and redirect to Stripe Checkout.

Webhook:
- `/api/billing/webhook` handles:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `invoice.paid`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`

Persist:
- `website.subscription_status = active | past_due | canceled`
- `website.plan = core`
- `website.stripe_customer_id`
- `website.stripe_subscription_id`

Post-checkout return:
- `GET /billing/success?website_id=...` -> route back to `/report/:scanId` with “Autopilot enabled” toast.

Event tracking:
- `core_checkout_started`
- `core_checkout_completed`
- `core_subscription_active`

---

## 6) Core Features Unlock When Paid
When Core is active for a website_id:
- Replace “Deploy Fixes” modal with deploy workflow (below)
- Enable scheduling controls (daily/weekly/on-demand)
- Enable notifications settings
- Show audit trail and “what changed” history (can be basic)

### Deploy Workflow (Paid)
When user clicks Deploy Fixes (paid user):
Show a modal:
- Option A: “Deploy top priority fixes” (default)
- Option B: “Select fixes” (checkbox list)
- Option C: “Dry run only” (generate PR / diff without applying)

For v1:
- If you do not have full PR automation:
  - “Deploy” creates tasks in a queue and marks them as pending
  - Show “Queued for execution” confirmation

API:
- `POST /api/scan/:scanId/deploy`
Payload:
- `{ website_id, mode: "top" | "selected" | "dry_run", selectedFixIds?: [] }`
Response:
- `{ ok: true, deployId }`

Event tracking:
- `deploy_clicked`
- `deploy_mode_selected`
- `deploy_queued`

---

## 7) Add-Ons (Crew Bundles) – Post-Core Upsells
Only show add-ons once:
- Core is active OR user clicks a feature that requires them.

Implement three add-on bundles:
1) Content Growth
2) Competitive Intelligence
3) Authority Signals

### Add-on UX
Surface add-ons contextually:
- If content gaps detected -> show banner: “Want Arclo to draft updates? Enable Content Growth”
- If competitor outranking -> “Enable Competitive Intelligence”
- If authority weaker -> “Enable Authority Signals”

Add-on purchase:
- Use Stripe add-on subscription items OR separate plans.

Endpoints:
- `POST /api/billing/enable-addon`
Payload:
- `{ website_id, addon: "content_growth" | "competitive_intel" | "authority_signals" }`

Persist:
- `website.addons = { content_growth: true/false, ... }`

Event tracking:
- `addon_prompt_viewed`
- `addon_checkout_started`
- `addon_enabled`

---

## 8) Messaging / Copy Requirements (Minimal, Outcome-Focused)
Do not mention “AI-powered” in hero.
Do not list internal crew names.

Suggested labels:
- “Diagnostic Mode”
- “Arclo Core (Autopilot)”
- “Arclo Managed Site”

Use “Cancel anytime” and “No contracts” near checkout CTA.

---

## 9) Operational Outputs (Retention Hooks)
### Monthly summary (v1 placeholder)
When Core active:
- Add `/summary/monthly` view in dashboard
- If data not ready, show placeholder structure:
  - Issues found
  - Fixes applied
  - Performance signals
  - Next recommended actions

Also create a scheduled job stub:
- Monthly run that generates a “summary record” per website

Event tracking:
- `monthly_summary_viewed`

---
