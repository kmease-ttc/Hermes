You are a senior frontend engineer and design-system owner working inside this Replit project. Your task is to **bring visual and interaction consistency to the Scan Results page** so it matches the modern, glassy, brand-forward aesthetic already present in the best parts of the UI.

This is a **design + UI refactor**, not a feature build. Do not change scan logic or data outputs.

---

## GOAL (what “done” looks like)

The entire Scan Results page should feel:

* Modern
* Intentional
* Cohesive
* Brand-consistent

Specifically:

* The **glass / frosted panels**, **colored iconography**, and **brand CTAs** already visible in the darker middle section should become the visual language for the rest of the page.
* Eliminate generic green usage where it conflicts with brand meaning.
* Make color usage semantic and consistent.

---

## CORE DESIGN RULES (non-negotiable)

### 1. Color semantics (this fixes most of the “off” feeling)

**Brand Gradient (purple → peach)**

* Use ONLY for **primary brand actions**

  * Analyze My Website
  * Generate My Site
  * Fix Everything Automatically
* Never replace this with green.

**Gold / Amber**

* Use for:

  * “Needs Attention”
  * Letter grades (C+, B-)
  * Lost traffic / risk numbers
  * Warning emphasis
* This is the “attention” color.

**Green**

* Use ONLY for:

  * “Good”
  * “Resolved”
  * Completed checks
  * Checkmarks
* Green is NOT a highlight or CTA color.

If something is green and it’s not “good” or “done”, it’s wrong.

---

### 2. Extend the glass system to the whole page

Right now, only one section uses the glass aesthetic correctly.

You must establish **three visual layers**:

#### Layer 1 – Page background

* Very light neutral or subtle gradient
* No heavy contrast
* This layer should never compete for attention

#### Layer 2 – Standard glass panels (MOST content)

Apply to:

* “What We Checked (So Far)” cards
* Metrics cards (traffic, clicks, leads)
* Any informational sections

Style:

* Semi-transparent white
* Subtle blur
* Soft shadow
* Rounded corners
* This should cover ~80% of the page

#### Layer 3 – Focus glass panels (hero / diagnosis)

Apply to:

* SEO Health grade
* Lost traffic summary
* Primary CTA cluster

Style:

* Slightly darker glass
* Stronger blur
* This is where the eye should land first

Do NOT add dark backgrounds just to be dark. The glass effect is the point.

---

### 3. Button hierarchy (must be enforced)

#### Primary (brand action)

* Brand gradient
* Used for:

  * Analyze
  * Generate
  * Fix Everything Automatically

#### Secondary (section-level action)

* Solid brand purple
* Used for:

  * Fix This
  * View Details

#### Tertiary (neutral / disabled)

* Glass outline
* Muted text
* Used for:

  * Preview
  * Limited Scan actions

Remove all **green buttons** unless the button literally means “Completed”.

---

### 4. Iconography consistency

Every card must have:

* One clear icon
* Icon must be colored intentionally (not gray)
* Color must reflect meaning:

  * Technical / neutral → brand purple
  * Warning / risk → gold or red
  * Success → green

No gray icons.
No default icon colors.

The icon clarity you see in the darker glass panel is the reference standard.

---

## CONCRETE TASKS (do these in order)

### Task 1: Refactor “What We Checked (So Far)”

* Convert all cards to **glass panels (Layer 2)**
* Replace flat white cards
* Ensure:

  * Colored icon
  * Status pill uses semantic color (green/gold/red)
  * “Fix This” uses brand purple (not green)

### Task 2: Fix metrics cards (traffic, clicks, leads)

* Make them glass panels
* Increase visual weight of numbers
* Use:

  * Red / gold for losses
  * Neutral text for labels
* No green here unless showing a positive improvement

### Task 3: Remove green highlights from non-success elements

Audit the page for:

* Green borders
* Green shadows
* Green buttons
  Replace with:
* Brand purple (actions)
* Gold (attention)

### Task 4: Normalize section spacing and rhythm

* Glass panels should align vertically
* Equal padding
* No section should feel “tacked on”

---

## OUT OF SCOPE (do NOT touch)

* Scan logic
* Data accuracy
* Backend APIs
* Pricing logic
* Authentication
* Publishing flow

This is **purely UI + design-system cleanup**.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (self-review before finishing)

* The page no longer uses green as a generic highlight
* Brand CTAs visually match “Analyze My Website”
* All cards feel like part of the same design system
* Glass aesthetic is consistent across sections
* Icons are colored and readable everywhere
* Nothing looks like a default SaaS dashboard anymore

---

If you’re unsure how to style something, **copy the treatment from the best-looking glass panel already on the page** and apply it consistently.

Do not invent new styles.

Make the page feel like it was designed, not assembled.
