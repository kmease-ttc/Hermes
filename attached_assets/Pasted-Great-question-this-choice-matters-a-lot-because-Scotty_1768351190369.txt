Great question — this choice matters a lot because **Scotty is your credibility anchor**. If Scotty’s KPI feels right, the whole system feels right.

I’ll give you a **clear recommendation**, explain *why*, then list **fallbacks** and **what not to use**.

---

## The ONE KPI Scotty should show on the home page

### ✅ **Technical Health Score (0–100)**

*(Composite score derived from crawlability, indexability, and critical errors)*

**Label:**
**Technical Health**

**Value example:**
**91**

**Subtext:**
“Your site’s ability to be crawled, indexed, and trusted by search engines”

### Why this is the right choice

This KPI succeeds on every dimension you care about:

1. **Instantly understandable to non-technical users**

   * “91/100” immediately answers: *am I okay or not?*
   * No explanation needed to know if it’s good or bad

2. **Abstracts complexity without hiding it**

   * Scotty does a LOT (crawl, render, index, canonicals, redirects, CWV blockers)
   * A composite score lets you hide the mess, then reveal details on click

3. **Maps cleanly to the Scotty dashboard**

   * Home page = “Are we healthy?”
   * Scotty page = “Why / what’s broken / how to fix”

4. **Works perfectly with trends**

   * ↑ Improving
   * → Stable
   * ↓ Declining
     This feels *alive* and reinforces value over time.

5. **Scales as Scotty gets smarter**

   * You can change the weighting internally without changing the UI contract.

## How to calculate it (conceptually)

You do **not** need to show this logic to users, but your system needs it.

Example weighting (you can tune later):

* Crawlability & status codes: 30%
* Indexability & noindex errors: 30%
* Critical technical errors (5xx, broken canonicals): 25%
* Render/index blockers (JS, hydration, robots): 15%

Normalize to 0–100.

If **critical blocking issues exist**, cap the score (e.g., max 70) — this creates urgency.

## How it should appear on the Capability card

**Scotty – Technical SEO**

```
91
Technical Health
↑ Improving
2 tasks open
Review →
```

* Number is **large and central**
* Color = Scotty’s orange
* Trend line is subtle but visible
* Tasks reinforce action without overwhelming

---

## What Scotty should NOT show on the home page

These are tempting but wrong for the *home*:

❌ **Completion Rate**

* Too abstract
* Sounds internal
* Users don’t care if *Scotty* completed tasks — they care if the *site* is healthy

❌ **# of Issues**

* Feels negative-first
* Scales poorly (100 issues sounds scary even if minor)
* Better for the Scotty detail page

❌ **Crawl Errors Count**

* Too technical for the main grid
* Good drill-down metric, not a hero KPI

---

## Fallback logic (important)

If Scotty has **never run** yet:

Show:

```
—
Technical Health
Run diagnostics to establish baseline
Run →
```

If Scotty is **active but missing some outputs**:

* Show last known score
* Add subtle “Partial data” chip (not scary)

---

## Secondary KPIs (Scotty detail page only)

Once inside Scotty’s page, *then* you show:

* Crawl Health %
* Index Coverage %
* Core Web Vitals blockers
* Critical Issues count

But **only one KPI belongs on the home grid**.

---

## Canonical contract for Scotty (for your identity system)

```ts
primaryKpi: {
  id: "technicalHealthScore",
  label: "Technical Health",
  unit: "score", // 0–100
}
```

Everything else hangs off this.

---

## Bottom line

If you remember one thing:

> **Home page KPIs answer “Am I okay?”
> Detail pages answer “Why?”**

For Scotty, **Technical Health Score** is the correct answer.

If you want, next we can:

* Lock the exact KPIs for **every other crew**
* Define trend semantics consistently
* Decide which KPIs can ever be negative vs neutral

But for Scotty — this is the right call.
