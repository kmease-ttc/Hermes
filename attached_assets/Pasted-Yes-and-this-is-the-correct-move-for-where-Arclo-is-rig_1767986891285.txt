Yes — and this is **the correct move** for where Arclo is right now.

You’re early, you’re asking for trust, and **“Website Analysis” is a lower-friction, higher-intent entry point** than “Generate My Site.” Generation is powerful, but analysis is the *permission slip*.

Below are **clear, copy-ready instructions** for how to implement this cleanly without breaking the flow you’ve already built.

---

# Update Primary CTA: Make “Website Analysis” Primary

## Strategic Rationale (Internal Alignment)

### Why this change is correct

* **Website analysis = low commitment, high curiosity**
* **Generate my site = high commitment**
* SMBs want validation before transformation

This matches natural buyer psychology:

> “Tell me what’s wrong before you fix everything.”

You’re not removing generation — you’re **earning the right to offer it**.

---

## Global CTA Hierarchy (Required)

### New CTA Priority Order

1. **Primary CTA (everywhere):**
   **Analyze My Website**

2. **Secondary CTA:**
   Generate My Site

3. **Tertiary (contextual only):**
   View demo / See example

---

## Header Changes (Critical)

### Current

* Primary button: **Generate My Site**
* Secondary links: Examples, How It Works, Pricing, Log In

### Update To

**Header right side (recommended order):**

* Examples
* How It Works
* Pricing
* Log In

**Primary Button (filled / gradient):**

* **Analyze My Website**

**Secondary Button (outline / subtle):**

* Generate My Site

### Visual Treatment

* “Analyze My Website” = high contrast, gradient
* “Generate My Site” = outline or muted gradient
* Do **not** give both equal weight

---

## Homepage Hero CTA Update

### Current (conceptually)

* Generate My Site

### Replace With

**Primary CTA:**

* **Analyze My Website**

  * Subtext (optional, small): *Takes ~60 seconds · No credit card*

**Secondary CTA (text or outline button):**

* Generate My Site

**Optional tertiary link:**

* See examples →

This keeps momentum but respects intent.

## Copy Update (Very Important)

### Change “Generate-first” framing → “Diagnose-first” framing

**Before (implied):**

> We build you a site.

**After (recommended):**

> We analyze, fix, then generate if needed.

### Example Hero Copy Adjustment

> **Autonomous SEO for Local Businesses**
> Start with a free website analysis. Arclo finds what’s holding your site back and fixes it automatically — or generates a better one if needed.

This subtly reframes generation as a *solution*, not the *starting point*.

---

## Examples Page CTA Update

On each example card:

### Current

* View demo
* Generate like this

### Update To

Primary:

* **Analyze My Website**

Secondary:

* Generate like this

Reason:
You’re saying “this is what *could* happen — let’s see where *you* stand first.”

---

## Pricing Page CTA Update

### Top CTA

* **Analyze My Website**

### Secondary CTA

* Generate My Site

### FAQ / Lower Sections

* Keep “Generate My Site” visible but not dominant

---

## Funnel Logic (Product Alignment)

This CTA change should map to the actual flow:

1. User clicks **Analyze My Website**
2. Enters domain
3. Gets:

   * High-level issues
   * Opportunities
   * “Fix Everything” preview
4. THEN you introduce:

   * Autopilot
   * Generation
   * Upgrade paths

This is *much* stronger than asking for generation upfront.

---

## What NOT to Do

* ❌ Do not remove “Generate My Site”
* ❌ Do not hide generation behind pricing
* ❌ Do not make both CTAs equal weight
* ❌ Do not force site generation without analysis

Generation should feel like:

> “Obviously the right next step.”

Not:

> “The first thing we’re pushing.”

---

## Success Criteria

This change is successful when:

* More users start the funnel
* Fewer bounce on hero
* Users feel guided, not sold
* “Generate My Site” feels earned, not forced

---

## One-Line Internal Principle

> **Diagnosis earns trust. Automation earns loyalty. Generation earns commitment.**

If you want next:

* We can tune **analysis output copy** to naturally upsell generation
* Or define **rules for when Arclo recommends generating a new site vs fixing**
* Or redesign the **Analyze → Fix → Generate** funnel as a single narrative

This was the right instinct.
