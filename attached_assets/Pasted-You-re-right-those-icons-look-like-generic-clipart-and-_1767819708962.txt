You’re right — those icons look like generic clipart and they’re also too low-contrast for the new light theme. The fix is to treat icons like part of the brand system (consistent style, stroke, color, and container), not random illustrations.

Here’s an on-brand approach that will look premium fast.

## What “on brand” should mean for Hermes

Pick one icon style and apply it everywhere:

* **Style:** outline or duotone (not flat clipart)
* **Stroke:** consistent thickness (2px is the sweet spot)
* **Corner radius:** slightly rounded
* **Color:** primary ink + Hermes green accent
* **Container:** every icon sits in the same “badge” shape so it feels intentional

## Recommended icon system (fastest win)

Use **Lucide** icons (clean, modern, consistent) and wrap them in a branded badge.

### Icons to use

* Diagnose: `SearchCheck` (or `Search`)
* Decide: `Target` (or `ListChecks`)
* Deploy: `Rocket` (or `Send`)

These will immediately look better than the current illustrations.

## Branded icon badge spec

Use the same container for every icon:

* Background: `#ECFDF5` (green tint)
* Border: `#BBF7D0`
* Icon color: `#15803D` (primary green)
* Subtle shadow: light

Example Tailwind:

* Badge: `bg-emerald-50 border border-emerald-200 rounded-2xl p-4 shadow-sm`
* Icon: `text-emerald-700`

## Implementation (Replit prompt / dev instructions)

1. Install Lucide

* `npm i lucide-react`

2. Create a reusable component:

* `client/src/components/marketing/IconBadge.tsx`

Behavior:

* Accepts `icon`, `title`, optional `variant`
* Enforces consistent sizing (32px icon)
* Uses the badge styling above

3. Replace the three current step images on `/how-it-works`

* Swap the magnifying glass illustration → `<IconBadge icon={SearchCheck} />`
* Swap the three circles → `<IconBadge icon={Target} />`
* Swap the rocketship → `<IconBadge icon={Rocket} />`

4. Keep the images only if you want custom illustrations later

* If you do want custom: generate a matching set (same stroke, same perspective, same style) and use them everywhere

## If you want custom illustrated icons (highest polish)

Instead of Lucide, create a bespoke set with:

* 2px stroke
* rounded ends
* 2-color system (Ink + Emerald)
* minimal shading
* consistent bounding box and padding

Tools:

* Figma + Iconify (or Illustrator)
* Export as SVG, inline them, and control colors via CSS variables

## Quick decision recommendation

For speed and quality: **Lucide + branded badge** now.
Later, if you want a unique feel: swap in custom SVGs with the same component API.

If you paste your current icon code (or tell me where those icons live—SVG files vs image assets vs component imports), I’ll give you the exact diff for the `HowItWorks` page and the new `IconBadge` component.
