You’re **almost** there, but there are **two required pieces missing / unverified**. This is one of those situations where everything *looks* filled in, but Google will silently fail if these aren’t exact.

Here’s a precise checklist against what I see in your screenshot.

---

## What’s OK ✅

These appear present already:

* **ADS_CUSTOMER_ID**
  Format should be: `7776029656` (no dashes)

* **GA4_PROPERTY_ID**
  Format should be: `123456789`
  (numeric only — *not* `G-XXXXXXX`)

If those formats are correct, you’re good there.

---

## What’s Missing / Blocking ⚠️

### 1. GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID ❌

Required
This comes from the **Google Cloud OAuth app**, not Ads or GA4.

Format:

```
xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

If this is empty → OAuth will not complete.

---

### 2. GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET ❌

Required
Paired with the client ID above.

Format:

```
GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If either the ID **or** secret is missing, Google auth will fail even though Ads + GA4 IDs exist.

---

### 3. GSC_SITE ❌ (very important)

This must be **exactly one of these formats**:

Preferred:

```
sc-domain:empathyhealthclinic.com
```

OR (only if you added URL-prefix verification instead):

```
https://www.empathyhealthclinic.com/
```

If this is blank or mismatched, Search Console API calls will return empty data.

---

## OAuth Callback (double-check once)

Your OAuth callback **must exactly match** what’s in Google Cloud:

```
https://<your-replit-url>.replit.app/api/auth/callback
```

No trailing slashes, no typos, no http/https mismatch.

---

## Final “You’re Done” State

You are **fully configured** only when all **5** are present:

* ADS_CUSTOMER_ID
* GA4_PROPERTY_ID
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
* GSC_SITE

Once those are in:

* OAuth popup should succeed
* Tokens will store automatically
* GA4, Ads, and GSC APIs will all work in Replit
* We can build the monitoring / remediation agent you want

---

### Bottom line

You **do not** need new accounts.
You **do** need to paste the OAuth client ID + secret and set `GSC_SITE`.

If you want, paste the **key names only** (not values) that are currently filled, and I’ll confirm in one pass whether anything else is missing.
