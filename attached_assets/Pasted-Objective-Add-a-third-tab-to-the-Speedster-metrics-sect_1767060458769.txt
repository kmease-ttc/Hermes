Objective
Add a third tab to the Speedster metrics section (next to “Core Vitals” and “Additional Metrics”) that shows **how many pages need fixing by issue type**. This gives an actionable backlog view instead of only per-metric scores.

New Tab Name (use one)

* “Issues”
* “Page Issues”
* “Fix Backlog”
  Pick one and keep it consistent with the design (short label preferred).

What the Tab Should Show (Primary View)
A summary dashboard that answers:

* “How many pages are impacted, by issue type?”

Required Output Format

1. A table (primary) with rows like:

* Issue Type
* Pages Affected (count)
* Severity (High/Med/Low or score)
* Primary Metric Impacted (LCP / CLS / INP / Other)
* Top Example URL (optional)
* Action (View pages)

2. A compact breakdown at the top (optional but nice):

* Total pages scanned
* Total issues found
* Pages with any critical issue

Issue Type Examples (do not hardcode; derive from data)

* Render-blocking resources
* Unoptimized images / oversized images
* Excessive JS execution / long tasks
* Too many requests / heavy page weight
* Slow server response (TTFB)
* Layout shift sources (CLS)
* Large DOM / heavy third-party scripts
* Missing caching headers (if tracked)
* Fonts blocking render
* Lazy-loading not enabled / misuse

Data Source Requirements (Critical)

* Do NOT guess issue counts.
* Use existing Speedster worker data if available.
* If the worker does not currently return a per-URL issue list, the UI must show a clear message:

  * “Issue breakdown unavailable (missing from API).”
  * “Needed fields: per_page_issues[] with url + issue_type + severity (+ metric).”
* If the data exists only at the audit/diagnostics layer, map it into the normalized Speedster dashboard shape.

Recommended Data Shape (Normalized)
Add to Speedster normalized response:

* `issuesSummary: { totalPagesScanned, totalIssues, impactedPages }`
* `issueTypes: Array<{ issueType: string, pagesAffected: number, severity: string|number, metric?: string, exampleUrl?: string }>`
* Optional drilldown:

  * `issuesByPage: Array<{ url: string, issues: Array<{ issueType, severity, metric? }> }>`

UI Behavior

* The tab should load instantly using last snapshot data if available.
* Provide a “Run Vitals Scan” CTA if the data is missing and can be generated by running a scan.
* Clicking “View pages” can open a simple modal listing affected URLs for that issue type (optional; implement if easy).

Placement / Layout Rules

* Tabs should be:

  * Core Vitals
  * Additional Metrics
  * Issues (new)
* Keep spacing and styling consistent with existing tabs.
* No new page route required; this is a tab within the existing Speedster section.

Acceptance Criteria

* A new “Issues” tab exists and is selectable.
* It displays issue types with counts of affected pages (from real data).
* If data is missing, it clearly tells us which fields are absent so we can update the worker.
* The rest of the dashboard remains unchanged and stable.
