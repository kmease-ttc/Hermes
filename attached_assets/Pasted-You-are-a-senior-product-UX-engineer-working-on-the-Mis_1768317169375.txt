You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **Mission Control dashboard**. The page is close, but it still lacks **visual grouping, prescriptive hierarchy, and consistent glow semantics**. Your task is to finish the layout so **each major section reads as a first-class, intentional decision zone**, not a stack of cards.

This is a **layout + visual system refactor**, not a data or backend change.

---

## CORE PROBLEMS TO FIX

1. Only **Key Metrics** has a strong colored glow/border — other sections feel visually weaker.
2. **Tasks** should visually signal urgency but currently blend into the background.
3. **Send Website Report** and **Send Developer Report** are split but should be a **single communication decision**.
4. **Run Diagnostics** should not live in the header — it should be a **first-class action card** like Fix Everything.

---

## NEW VISUAL SYSTEM RULE (LOCK THIS IN)

> **Every major section gets a colored glow border that communicates intent.**

This creates instant visual parsing and emotional guidance.

### Glow color meanings

* **Purple** → Insight / Reporting / Understanding
* **Yellow / Gold** → Action required / Tasks / Attention
* **Green** → Execution / System actions (run, fix, automate)

You already did this correctly for Key Metrics — extend it everywhere.

---

## PART 1 — Add colored glow borders to major sections

### A) Tasks section

**Current:** Neutral glass
**Change to:**

* Add a **yellow / gold glow border**
* Same glow strength as Key Metrics (not stronger)
* Purpose: signal “these need attention”

Label remains:

* **Tasks**

This visually connects:

> “Tasks” ↔ “Needs attention”

---

### B) Send Report section

**Current:** Two separate purple cards
**Change to:**

* Consolidate into **ONE card**
* Add a **purple glow border**

Purpose:

> This is about communication, not fixing.

---

### C) Fix Everything For Me

**Keep as-is**, but ensure:

* It remains the **most visually dominant**
* Purple glow is slightly stronger than others
* This is the default recommendation

---

## PART 2 — Consolidate “Send Website Report” + “Send Developer Report”

### Replace both cards with ONE card:

#### Card title

**Send Reports**

#### Description

“Review and send tailored reports depending on who you’re sharing with.”

#### Inside the card (two CTAs, stacked or side-by-side)

* **Send Business Report**

  * Subtitle (small): “For owners, stakeholders, weekly summaries”
* **Send Technical Report**

  * Subtitle (small): “For developers and agencies”

Both buttons:

* Secondary accent (purple outline / glass)
* NOT green
* NOT gradient

Behavior:

* Clicking either routes to:

  * `/reports/business`
  * `/reports/technical`
* Both go to **review-before-send** pages (already planned)

This removes clutter and clarifies intent.

---

## PART 3 — Add a new “Run Diagnostics” card (move it out of the header)

### Remove from header:

* The “Run Diagnostics” button must be removed entirely from the top bar.

### Add a new card in the Primary Action row:

#### Card title

**Run Diagnostics**

#### Description

“Re-scan your site to detect new issues and update metrics.”

#### CTA (green, system action)

> Run Diagnostics

#### Visual styling

* **Green glow border**
* Same size as Send Reports card
* Less dominant than Fix Everything

Purpose:

> “I want fresh data, not fixes yet.”

---

## PART 4 — Final Primary Action Card Row (TARGET STATE)

The top row should now have **4 cards**, in this order:

1. **Fix Everything For Me**

   * Purple glow (strongest)
   * Primary gradient CTA

2. **Send Reports**

   * Purple glow
   * Two report CTAs inside (Business / Technical)

3. **Run Diagnostics**

   * Green glow
   * System action CTA

(If space is tight, Fix Everything remains dominant; others equal size.)

---

## PART 5 — Ensure Key Metrics glow is the reference standard

* Do NOT change the Key Metrics glow — it’s the benchmark.
* Match:

  * Border thickness
  * Glow softness
  * Corner radius
* Other sections should feel like **siblings**, not different systems.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (DO NOT SKIP)

Before finishing, confirm:

* Tasks section has a **yellow/gold glow**
* Send Reports has a **purple glow**
* Fix Everything remains the most visually dominant
* Run Diagnostics is no longer in the header
* Run Diagnostics exists as a **green-glow action card**
* No section feels visually “flat” compared to Key Metrics
* The page can be understood in 5 seconds by color alone

If you squint and can’t tell where to:

* Fix
* Communicate
* Refresh data

…then the glow semantics are not strong enough.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Color is instruction. Layout is authority.**

This dashboard should guide behavior **before the user reads a single word**.

Finish this pass so the page *tells* users what to do — not asks.
