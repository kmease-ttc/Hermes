Objective
Enhance the **Industry Benchmarks** section so it visually mirrors the Core Web Vitals cards by adding a **horizontal benchmark indicator line** that clearly shows **where the user’s metric sits relative to p25 / p50 / p75 / p90**.

This is a **visual clarity upgrade** only. No metric logic changes.

---

Problem to Solve
Right now, Industry Benchmarks are readable but cognitively heavy:

* The user sees percentile numbers (p25, p50, p75, p90)
* They see “Your: X”
* But they **cannot quickly see where they land on a continuum**, unlike the Core Web Vitals cards above, which are excellent.

We want the same “at-a-glance” clarity.

---

Required Change (Core Behavior)

For **each Industry Benchmark row** (LCP, CLS, INP, Performance Score):

Add a **horizontal benchmark bar** directly beneath the metric label that:

* Shows the percentile range visually (left → right)
* Uses the same color logic as Core Web Vitals:

  * Green → Good
  * Yellow → Needs Work
  * Red → Poor
* Includes a **marker/dot** indicating “Your” current position on the bar

This should feel like a *compact cousin* of the Core Web Vitals slider—not a full duplicate.

---

Visual Specification

Each Industry Benchmark row should have:

1. Metric Header (existing)

* Example: `LCP (Loading)`
* “Your: 6.71s” badge stays as-is

2. NEW: Benchmark Line (added)

* A thin horizontal bar spanning p25 → p90
* Segmented or gradient-based:

  * p25–p50 (green)
  * p50–p75 (yellow)
  * p75–p90 (red)
* A circular marker (dot or pin) placed at the correct relative position for “Your” value

3. Percentile Labels (existing)

* p25, p50, p75, p90 labels remain below or above the bar
* Do not remove the numeric values

4. Status Badge (existing)

* “Top 50%”, “Bottom 25%”, etc. remains unchanged

---

Metric-Specific Rules

* LCP / CLS / INP:

  * Lower is better
  * Bar direction should reflect that (left = better, right = worse)
* Performance Score:

  * Higher is better
  * Bar direction should invert (left = worse, right = better)
* Ensure the marker logic accounts for directionality correctly.

---

Implementation Guidance

* Reuse or lightly adapt the existing Core Web Vitals slider component if possible:

  * Strip interactivity
  * Reduce height
  * Lock it to read-only
* Alternatively, create a lightweight `BenchmarkPositionBar` component:

  * Props:

    * value
    * p25, p50, p75, p90
    * direction (“lower-is-better” | “higher-is-better”)
* Do not introduce new chart libraries.

---

What NOT to Change

* Do not remove numeric benchmark values
* Do not add tooltips unless they already exist
* Do not change benchmark data sources
* Do not make it interactive

---

Acceptance Criteria

* Each Industry Benchmark row has a clear horizontal bar
* The user can instantly see where they sit relative to benchmarks
* Visual style is consistent with Core Web Vitals cards
* The section feels significantly more intuitive without adding clutter

This should make Industry Benchmarks feel as polished and immediately understandable as the Core Web Vitals section above it.
