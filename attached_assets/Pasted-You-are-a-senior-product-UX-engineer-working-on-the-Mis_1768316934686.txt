You are a senior product + UX engineer working on the **Mission Control dashboard**. The dashboard is now strong at telling users *what to do next*, but it is missing a critical psychological component: **visible progress**. Your task is to add an **Accomplishments section** that rewards progress and builds momentum.

This is a **UI + light data wiring change**. Do not introduce complex gamification or new backend systems unless necessary.

---

## OBJECTIVE (why this matters)

Right now the dashboard emphasizes:

* What’s broken
* What needs fixing
* What to do next

That creates urgency, but **no sense of progress**.

We need a section that answers:

> “Is this actually working?”

This improves:

* Retention
* Trust
* Willingness to click “Fix Everything”
* Willingness to stay subscribed

---

## PLACEMENT (very important)

Insert a new section called **Accomplishments**:

**Layout order must be:**

1. Primary Action Cards (Fix Everything / Send Reports)
2. **Accomplishments (NEW)**
3. Tasks
4. Key Metrics
5. What Needs Fixing

Accomplishments must sit **between Quick Actions and Tasks**.
This way the user sees:

> “Here’s what we did → here’s what’s next.”

---

## SECTION NAME & TONE

### Section title

**Accomplishments**

Optional subtitle (small, muted):

> “Progress made so far”

Do NOT call this:

* History
* Logs
* Audit trail

This is about **wins**, not records.

---

## VISUAL DESIGN (must match system)

* Use the same **glass panel styling** as Tasks and Key Metrics
* Slightly lighter than Tasks (less urgency)
* Calm, positive tone
* No red
* Minimal gold
* Mostly neutral + green for success

This section should feel **rewarding**, not stressful.

---

## CONTENT MODEL (keep it simple)

Show **3–5 recent accomplishments**, max.

Each item includes:

* Icon (green check / upward arrow / spark)
* Short title (action-oriented)
* Subtext (what changed)
* Relative time (“Today”, “Yesterday”, “2 days ago”)

### Example items

* **Analytics connected**
  GA4 and Search Console data successfully synced
  *Today*

* **Indexing issues resolved**
  12 pages confirmed indexed by Google
  *Yesterday*

* **Content insights collected**
  22 new learnings added to your knowledge base
  *2 days ago*

* **Performance improvements detected**
  Core Web Vitals data updated across key pages
  *3 days ago*

---

## DATA SOURCING (do not overengineer)

Use **existing execution / task completion data**.

Implementation guidance:

* Pull from the same place you already record:

  * completed tasks
  * successful runs
  * integrations enabled
* Filter:

  * status = success
  * order by most recent
* Limit to last 7–14 days
* Display top 3–5 only

If no accomplishments yet:

* Show a soft empty state:

  > “Your accomplishments will appear here as tasks complete.”

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

* Do NOT show failures here
* Do NOT show raw logs
* Do NOT show technical jargon
* Do NOT make it clickable for now
* Do NOT add charts or graphs

This is about **emotional reinforcement**, not analytics.

---

## OPTIONAL (nice-to-have, not required)

If easy to implement:

* Small summary badge in header:

  * “7 improvements completed”
* Or:

  * “Last update: Today”

But keep it understated.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking done, verify:

* Accomplishments section appears **between Quick Actions and Tasks**
* It uses glass styling consistent with the rest of the dashboard
* Items are phrased as **wins**, not system events
* Green is used sparingly and positively
* The section makes the dashboard feel *progressive*, not punitive

If the user scrolls and thinks:

> “Oh — things are actually getting better.”

…then it’s working.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **People don’t stay for dashboards. They stay for progress.**

This section should quietly prove that Arclo is doing real work on their behalf.
