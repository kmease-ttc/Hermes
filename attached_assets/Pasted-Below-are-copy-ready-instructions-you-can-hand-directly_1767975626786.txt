Below are **copy-ready instructions** you can hand directly to the development team. This is written as an internal implementation brief, not marketing copy.

# Hermes Navigation & IA Update — Dev Instructions

## Objective

Update Hermes’ navigation and information architecture to reinforce **decision simplicity**, not feature exploration.

Hermes is **not a toolkit**. It is an outcome-driven product designed for busy business owners who do not want to think about SEO. Navigation must reflect that.

We are **learning selectively** from competitors like SEOptimer, not copying their structure.

---

## Guiding Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No feature mega menus**
2. **No tool taxonomy in the header**
3. **Navigation must answer only three questions:**

   * What happens?
   * Is this for someone like me?
   * How much does it cost?
4. Depth belongs **inside pages and in the footer**, not the header
5. First-time visitors should understand Hermes in **under 5 seconds**

---

## Header Navigation (Final, Approved Structure)

### Layout

**Left**

* Hermes logo (home link)

**Right (text links)**

* How It Works
* Use Cases
* Pricing
* Log In

**Primary CTA (button, visually distinct)**

* Get Free SEO Action Plan

That is the full header.
No additional items. No dropdowns. No mega menus.

---

## Explicitly Do NOT Add

* ❌ “Features” menu
* ❌ “Tools” menu
* ❌ Mega menu of SEO capabilities
* ❌ Agency-style navigation patterns
* ❌ Secondary CTAs competing with the primary CTA

If a capability cannot fit naturally inside *How It Works* or *Use Cases*, it belongs in the footer.

---

## How Features Are Represented (Instead of a Features Tab)

### 1. How It Works Page

This page implicitly communicates capabilities through flow, not lists.

It should explain:

* Input (site URL)
* Analysis (what Hermes checks automatically)
* Output (prioritized action plan)
* Execution (what gets fixed / monitored)

Avoid enumerating tools. Show outcomes.

---

### 2. Use Cases Page

Use Cases should contextualize features without naming them as features.

Examples:

* “Local service business”
* “Healthcare practice”
* “Property management”
* “No website yet”

Each use case should:

* State the problem
* Show what Hermes does
* Show the result

This replaces the need for a Features menu.

---

## Footer Navigation (Where Depth Lives)

Footer should feel **rich but quiet**. This is where advanced users can self-validate without overwhelming others.

### Footer Section: Product

* How It Works
* Use Cases
* Pricing
* Create a Site (No site? No problem)

### Footer Section: Capabilities

(Flat list — no submenus required)

* Technical SEO
* Keyword Opportunities
* Content Optimization
* Competitor Analysis
* Performance Monitoring

These can be anchor links or lightweight pages later.

### Footer Section: Examples

* Empathy Health Clinic
* Lucky Thunder Property Management
* The Farm Texas

Each should link to either:

* A live example
* Or a case-style page showing before/after

### Footer Section: Company

* About
* Contact
* Privacy
* Terms

---

## “No Site? No Problem” Handling

* Do **not** add this as a primary header item
* It should live:

  * As a small link on the homepage
  * In the Product section of the footer
* This path should feel optional, not dominant

The default assumption remains: *“You already have a site.”*

---

## Optional Trust Enhancements (Allowed Near Header)

These may appear **near the CTA**, but not as nav items:

* “No credit card required”
* “~60 seconds”
* “Works with any public website”

These should be visually secondary and non-interactive.

---

## Success Criteria

We should be able to say “yes” to all of the following:

* A first-time visitor understands Hermes without scrolling
* There is no feeling of complexity or exploration
* The nav feels calm, confident, and intentional
* Power users can still find depth via Use Cases and Footer
* Hermes feels fundamentally different from SEO tool vendors

---

## Internal Alignment Statement (For Team Context)

Hermes is selling **relief and confidence**, not software access.
Navigation should reinforce *deciding*, not *browsing*.

---

## Implementation Notes

* This is primarily an **IA and copy update**, not a visual redesign
* Mobile nav should mirror the same hierarchy (no collapsible feature trees)
* Do not introduce new pages beyond what’s listed here
* Keep labels exactly as specified unless approved

---

If you want next steps queued for the team:

* Rewrite **Use Cases** to fully replace a Features menu
* Finalize **Pricing page** to anchor the nav correctly
* Design a **high-credibility footer layout** that doesn’t feel heavy

This direction is deliberate. The competitor reference validates it — we are intentionally choosing the opposite path.
