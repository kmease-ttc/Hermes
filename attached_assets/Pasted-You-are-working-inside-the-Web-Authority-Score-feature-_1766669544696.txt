You are working inside the **Web Authority Score** feature of the Technical SEO tool.

I want to add a **new tab called “Competitors”** alongside the existing Authority/Performance/etc. tabs.

### Data Source

* Use the existing **Competitor Service** to identify the **top 10 competitors** for the currently selected primary domain.
* The primary domain is whatever website the user has selected (e.g. empathyhealthclinic.com).
* Do not hardcode competitors; always resolve them dynamically from the competitor service.

### Behavior

1. When the user opens the **Competitors** tab:

   * Fetch the top 10 competitors for the selected domain.
   * Fetch **web authority metrics** for:

     * The primary domain
     * Each competitor domain

2. Metrics should reuse the **same authority calculation logic** already used in the Web Authority Score view to ensure consistency.

### UI Requirements

* Display the data in a **comparison grid / table**.
* The **first row** should always be the **primary domain**, visually highlighted (e.g. bold row or badge like “You”).
* Each subsequent row represents one competitor.

### Columns (at minimum)

* Domain
* Web Authority Score
* Domain Authority
* Total Backlinks
* Referring Domains
* Organic Keywords
* Monthly Organic Traffic
* Average Position

(Use existing metrics where available; do not introduce new calculations unless required.)

### UX Details

* Clearly label the primary site vs competitors.
* Sort competitors by Web Authority Score descending by default.
* Handle loading and error states gracefully (e.g. competitor service unavailable).
* If fewer than 10 competitors are returned, display all available competitors without empty rows.

### Technical Notes

* Do not duplicate logic; call shared services/utilities already used by the Web Authority Score.
* The Competitors tab should be read-only (no editing).
* Keep the implementation modular so additional competitor metrics can be added later.

The goal is to let users quickly understand **how their site’s authority compares side-by-side against competitors using the same scoring system**, all in one grid view.
