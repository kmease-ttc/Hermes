You are a senior product-minded frontend engineer working inside the Hermes SEO (authenticated app) codebase. Your task is to **finish the Mission Control dashboard and reporting experience by clarifying report types, improving locked metrics enticement, and unifying the mental model for metrics, tasks, and execution**.

This is a **product + UX refinement pass**, not a backend rewrite. Implement incrementally and safely.

---

## OBJECTIVE (what “done” means)

Mission Control should clearly answer three user intents:

1. **Understand** – “How is my website doing right now and over time?”
2. **Share** – “I need something I can send to my developer/agency.”
3. **Fix** – “Just fix this for me.”

At the same time:

* Key Metrics and Coverage should feel like **one system**
* Locked metrics should feel **enticing**, not empty
* Each crew should surface **one meaningful free metric**
* Tasks (missions) should feel concrete and countable

---

## PART 1 — Replace “Export Fix Pack” with clear report types

### Remove / rename:

* Remove the label **“Export Fix Pack”**

### Add 3 clear actions along the top of Mission Control:

#### 1) Website Report (default / understanding)

Label:

* **Website Report**

Purpose:

* Current site health
* Key metrics (owned + locked preview)
* Task counts
* This will later power the **weekly email**

Behavior:

* This is the default dashboard view
* No download required

CTA copy:

* “View Website Report”

---

#### 2) Developer Report (shareable)

Label:

* **Developer Report**

Purpose:

* Neutral, technical report
* No upsell language
* Something users feel comfortable sending to a dev or agency

Behavior:

* Generates a shareable report (PDF or link)
* Focus on findings + tasks

CTA copy:

* “Generate Developer Report”

---

#### 3) Fix Everything For Me (execution)

Label:

* **Fix Everything For Me**

Purpose:

* Managed execution
* This is the primary monetization moment

On first use:

* Prompt the user to choose execution method:

  * WordPress Plugin (free)
  * Move site to Arclo (paid – explain briefly)
  * Request another integration

Store their choice for future runs.

---

## PART 2 — Merge Key Metrics + Coverage into one system

### Change the mental model:

* Remove the idea of “Coverage” as a separate section
* **All metrics should be visible**
* Some metrics are:

  * Active (owned)
  * Locked (not yet enabled)

### Implementation rules:

* Show ALL metric cards in the Key Metrics grid
* Owned metrics:

  * Fully visible
* Locked metrics:

  * Still visible
  * Clearly labeled “Locked”
  * Visually enticing (not empty)

---

## PART 3 — Make locked metrics enticing (critical)

Locked metric cards must show:

* Metric name
* Example or blurred value (e.g. “~12,400 / month” or “— — —”)
* Why it matters (1 short line)
* How many tasks it unlocks
* Clear CTA

### Example (Popular / Analytics):

**Monthly Sessions**
“~12,400 visits / month”
“Understand traffic trends and drops”
Unlocks **4 tasks**
Button: “Enable Traffic Analytics”

Do NOT show “Enable Popular” alone. Always show the *value first*.

---

## PART 4 — One free metric per crew (sample data)

Each crew should expose **one meaningful metric for free**, even if the crew is not enabled.

Examples:

* Speedster: Overall Performance Score (based on worst LCP)
* Hemingway: Content Quality Score (sampled)
* Scotty: Pages with Errors (limited crawl)
* Popular: Monthly Sessions (last 7 days only)
* Lookout: Pages Losing Traffic (count only)

Label clearly:

* “Sample data”
* “Unlock full metrics”

This proves the system is real and increases conversion.

---

## PART 5 — Big metric + task count per crew

Each crew card (in Mission Control) should show:

* One **primary metric** (large)
* One line: “X tasks to complete”
* CTA:

  * “Review Tasks” (if enabled)
  * “Enable” (if not)

Avoid showing many small stats per crew here. Keep it scannable.

---

## PART 6 — Unify language: use “Tasks”, not “Missions”

User-facing language:

* Replace “missions” with **“tasks”**
* Examples:

  * “3 tasks to complete”
  * “View tasks”
  * “Tasks completed this week”

Internal naming can stay as missions if needed, but UI should say “tasks”.

---

## PART 7 — Tasks aggregation on Mission Control

Mission Control must:

* Aggregate tasks from all enabled crews
* Show:

  * Top 3 tasks (by priority)
  * Total open tasks count

If tasks exist on crew pages:

* Mission Control must NOT say “No open tasks”

This uses the same source-of-truth as crew pages.

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (before finishing)

* “Export Fix Pack” is gone
* Mission Control clearly shows:

  * Website Report
  * Developer Report
  * Fix Everything For Me
* Key Metrics shows:

  * Owned + locked metrics together
  * Enticing locked cards
* Each crew shows:

  * One free sample metric
  * Task count
* Language consistently says “tasks”
* Dashboard answers:

  * How am I doing?
  * What needs fixing?
  * What happens if I click this?

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

Every section should answer one of these questions:

* “Do I understand my site?”
* “Can I share this safely?”
* “Can this fix things for me?”

If a UI element doesn’t clearly support one of those, simplify or remove it.

Build toward clarity and confidence, not more surface area.
