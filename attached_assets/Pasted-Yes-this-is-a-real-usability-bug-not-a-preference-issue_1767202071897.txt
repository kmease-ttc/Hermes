Yes — this is a real usability bug, not a preference issue. You’re absolutely right. Anywhere we have a pullout / overlay / floating menu, transparency is actively breaking readability.

Below is a clear, enforceable prompt you can paste into Replit to fix this globally, without bikeshedding.

PROMPT — Fix Pullout / Overlay Menu Opacity (Global UX Bug)

You are a senior ARCLO frontend engineer.

We have a usability issue across the app: pullout menus and overlay panels are too transparent, making content behind them visible and causing readability problems.

This is not acceptable for navigation or decision-making UI.

Your task is to standardize pullout / overlay opacity across the app so these surfaces are clearly readable while still fitting ARCLO’s visual style.

⸻

AFFECTED UI (NON-EXHAUSTIVE)

This applies to all overlay-style UI, including:
	•	Left-side pullout menus
	•	Crew selector dropdowns
	•	Mission / status dropdowns
	•	Context menus
	•	Slide-over panels
	•	Any floating menu that sits above page content

If a panel floats above content and contains interactive controls, it is affected.

⸻

REQUIRED VISUAL CHANGE

Opacity Rule (MANDATORY)

All pullout / overlay surfaces must be:
	•	Opaque enough to fully obscure background content
	•	Acceptable opacity range: 90%–95%
	•	Background content should NOT be legible through the panel

This is a hard requirement.

⸻

STYLE GUIDELINES

Allowed
	•	Dark surface color matching ARCLO cards
	•	Slight translucency (glass feel)
	•	Subtle blur if already used elsewhere
	•	Soft border or divider

Not Allowed
	•	Fully transparent or semi-transparent menus
	•	Seeing page text, charts, or cards through menus
	•	Relying on blur alone to improve legibility

Blur does NOT replace opacity.

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
	1.	Identify the shared component(s) used for:
	•	Pullout menus
	•	Slide-over panels
	•	Dropdown overlays
	2.	Update their base background style to:
	•	Dark ARCLO surface color
	•	Opacity between 0.9 and 0.95
	•	Consistent across the app
	3.	Ensure:
	•	Text inside overlays has strong contrast
	•	Icons and actions are immediately readable
	•	No background UI competes visually
	4.	Apply this fix globally, not per-instance.

If there is no shared component:
	•	Create a shared overlay surface style
	•	Refactor existing overlays to use it

⸻

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (VERY CLEAR)

This is considered complete only when:
	•	You can open any pullout or overlay
	•	And cannot read or visually parse the UI behind it
	•	While still preserving ARCLO’s dark, modern aesthetic

If you can still “see what’s going on behind it,” it is wrong.

⸻

DESIGN INTENT (IMPORTANT)

These panels are:
	•	Navigation
	•	Configuration
	•	Decision surfaces

They are not decorative glass layers.

Clarity > visual flair.

⸻

QUICK SELF-TEST

Open a pullout menu.
Squint.
If you can still tell what page you’re on behind it → fail.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Write a CSS token change (e.g., --overlay-surface-opacity)
	•	Audit the app and list every component that should inherit this
	•	Provide a one-line Tailwind / CSS fix if you want it ultra-fast

Just say which.
