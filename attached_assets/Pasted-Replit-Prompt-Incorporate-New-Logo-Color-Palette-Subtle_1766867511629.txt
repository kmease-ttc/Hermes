Replit Prompt: Incorporate New Logo Color Palette + “Subtle Spectrum” Design System Across the App

Objective  
We’ve introduced a new logo with a distinctive multi-color / rainbow-spectrum palette. Update the application’s visual design to *harmonize with the logo* while keeping the UI professional, calm, and AI-first — not playful or noisy.

This is **not** a rebrand or redesign from scratch. It’s a **design system refinement** that uses the logo’s palette as an accent language.

### Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Subtle, not literal**
   - Do NOT add rainbow gradients everywhere.
   - Use the palette as *accents*, *states*, and *motion hints* — never as background noise.

2. **Professional AI aesthetic**
   - Think: Stripe / Linear / Vercel
   - Avoid anything that feels playful, childish, or “marketing-site”

3. **Hierarchy first**
   - Color should reinforce meaning (status, confidence, priority)
   - Never replace layout, spacing, or typography as the primary signal

---

### Step 1: Extract the Logo Palette (Single Source of Truth)

Create a centralized palette file (e.g. `theme/colors.ts`):

- Extract **5–7 core colors** from the logo:
  - Primary anchor color
  - 2–3 secondary hues (from the spectrum)
  - 1 warm accent
  - 1 cool accent
- Generate **light / muted / subtle variants** for each (opacity-based, not new hues)

Example structure:
- `brand.primary`
- `brand.accentBlue`
- `brand.accentGreen`
- `brand.accentAmber`
- `brand.accentViolet`
- `brand.subtle.*` (used for borders, backgrounds, hover states)

All components must reference these tokens — no ad-hoc colors.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Palette Strategically (Where It Actually Matters)

#### A) Navigation + Header
- Logo remains full-color
- Use **one primary brand color** for:
  - Active nav item
  - Primary CTA (Run Diagnostics, Export, etc.)
- Add a *very subtle* spectrum gradient only on:
  - Hover underline
  - Active state border
  - Focus ring

No gradients as backgrounds.

---

#### B) Status & Verdict System (High Value Area)
Map logo colors to semantic meaning:

- Good → brand green (muted)
- Watch → brand amber
- Alert / Bad → brand red (softened)
- Confidence levels → gradient *hint* (low → high)

Example:
- Confidence badge uses a left-to-right spectrum fill at **5–10% opacity**
- Progress bars can use a spectrum *fill*, but neutral track

---

#### C) Cards (Mission Control, Recommendations, Metrics)
- Keep card backgrounds neutral (white / near-white)
- Add **thin accent elements**:
  - Left border
  - Top rule
  - Progress bar
- Only one accent per card — never multiple colors competing

Recommendation cards:
- Priority number uses a distinct logo color
- “Review →” CTA inherits the card’s accent color

---

#### D) Charts & Sparklines
This is where the palette really shines:

- Use **single-color lines** (not rainbow)
- Use gradient *fills* derived from logo colors:
  - Top stronger → bottom transparent
- Different metrics can use different brand accents, but consistently:
  - Traffic → blue family
  - Conversions → green
  - Engagement → amber
  - Authority → violet

Never mix multiple hues in one chart.

---

#### E) Agent System
- Each agent is assigned **one palette color** (from logo set)
- That color is reused for:
  - Agent score bar
  - Agent card accent
  - Recommendation chips
  - Review buttons

No avatars or illustrations added here — color + icon only.

---

### Step 3: Motion & Micro-Interactions (Very Light)
- Hover states:
  - Color shifts within same hue family
- Progress animations:
  - Smooth easing
  - Subtle glow at completion (brand color, low opacity)
- Focus states:
  - Thin spectrum ring (2px max, low opacity)

If motion is noticeable, it’s too much.

---

### Step 4: Guardrails (Prevent Overuse)

Add constraints:
- No more than **one brand color per component**
- Gradients allowed only in:
  - Progress bars
  - Charts
  - Confidence indicators
- Backgrounds must stay neutral

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- The app visually “feels” tied to the new logo without becoming colorful everywhere
- The logo looks intentional, not isolated
- Color reinforces meaning (status, priority, confidence)
- No rainbow backgrounds
- No playful or juvenile tone introduced
- Dark mode (if present) still works cleanly

---

### Deliverables

- Centralized color token file
- Updated components:
  - Header / Nav
  - Mission Control cards
  - Recommendation cards
  - Key Metric cards
  - Charts / sparklines
  - Agent cards
- Visual QA pass to ensure consistency

This is a **design system refinement**, not a redesign. Optimize for clarity, confidence, and cohesion.
