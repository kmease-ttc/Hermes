Objective
Fix a UX regression where, after making updates related to Speedster, the app unexpectedly navigates to the Lookout (SERP) page. After any update/refresh/save action, the user must remain on the currently active crew dashboard route.

Observed Bug
While working on the Speedster dashboard, after an action completes (refresh/run/save/fix), the UI redirects to /agents/serp_intel (Lookout). This is incorrect.

Required Behavior

* If the user is on /agents/speedster (or Speedster route), they must remain on that route after:

  * Refresh
  * Save
  * Fix Everything
  * Running a worker check
  * Any integration call completion
  * Any auto-reload / state update
* No action on Speedster should trigger navigation to Lookout (or any other crew).

Likely Causes (Investigate + Fix)

1. Global “afterRun” navigation

* A shared handler in CrewDashboardShell, Mission Control, or the orchestrator client may redirect to a “default crew” after any run completes.
* Remove any hardcoded redirect like:

  * navigate("/agents/serp_intel")
  * setActiveCrew("lookout")
  * router.push(defaultCrewRoute)

2. Incorrect activeCrewKey updates

* A global store may be setting activeCrewKey to "lookout" after a run.
* Ensure actions update only data state, not route state.
* activeCrewKey should be derived from the current route (single source of truth), not mutated by worker results.

3. Shared polling / refresh handler

* A shared polling loop might be refreshing multiple crew states and setting the route based on whichever resolves last.
* Ensure polling never triggers navigation.

4. “Fix Everything” action using Mission Control route

* If Fix Everything is routed through Mission Control and returns a “redirectTo” field, ignore it unless explicitly requested.
* Ensure the caller does not navigate after success.

Implementation Requirements

* Treat “current route” as authoritative.
* Remove any post-action navigation unless:

  * The user clicked a link intentionally, OR
  * A modal explicitly asks to navigate.

Technical Fix Requirements

* Search codebase for:

  * navigate("/agents/serp_intel")
  * router.push("/agents/serp_intel")
  * setActiveCrew("lookout")
  * defaultCrewRoute
  * afterRunRedirect
  * onRunComplete navigation
* If a “default crew” fallback exists, it should only run when:

  * The current route is invalid / unknown, OR
  * No crew is selected yet (first app load)

Add Guardrails (Must Implement)

* In CrewDashboardShell (or the shared dashboard wrapper), explicitly prevent route changes on mutation events:

  * Do not call navigate() in refresh/run handlers.
  * Ensure state updates do not change selected crew.

Acceptance Criteria

* Run/refresh/fix actions on Speedster never change the URL.
* The user stays on the Speedster dashboard after all actions.
* Lookout page is only reached if the user navigates there intentionally.
