Replit Prompt: Restore the “My Crew” Blue Space Gradient and Make It the Global App Background

Goal
The My Crew page originally had a better “space” feel: a deep blue, slightly colorful gradient background. Recent styling changes standardized everything to a flat dark (#070A14), which made the app feel too black and heavy. Restore the My Crew “bluey gradient” background and apply it across the entire app as the default background.

This is a global theming update. Do not change functionality.

What to do (high level)

1. Reintroduce the original My Crew gradient background treatment.
2. Make that gradient the global default background for the entire app (Mission Control, Agents, Integrations, Settings, etc.).
3. Ensure cards/panels still read clearly with good contrast (glass cards floating on top).

Implementation details

A) Define a single global background token
Create a theme token in one place (preferably CSS variables), e.g.:

* `--app-bg` (solid fallback)
* `--app-bg-gradient` (primary)
* `--app-bg-vignette` (optional)

Example (use a tasteful “space blue” gradient, not neon):

* Base: deep navy
* Mid: slightly brighter blue
* Edge: subtle indigo/purple tint
* Add a soft vignette for depth

B) Apply the gradient at the root layout level
Update the global app wrapper (Layout / AppShell / body) so ALL pages inherit it:

* Set background to the gradient token
* Ensure the background covers full height and doesn’t “reset” between routes
* Remove per-page background overrides that fight it

C) Keep dark-mode readability

* Cards remain dark-glass panels (semi-transparent)
* Text stays high contrast
* Avoid making the background too bright; the goal is “space blue,” not “light theme”

D) Remove the flat black override
Find where #070A14 was enforced as the primary background and replace it with the gradient token.
Keep #070A14 as a fallback base layer under the gradient.

E) Ensure side nav + content areas match

* Side nav should sit naturally on the same gradient (or slightly darker panel layer)
* No page should have a different background unless explicitly required

Acceptance criteria

* The entire app uses the “space blue” gradient background (like the My Crew feel)
* No pages show a flat pure-black background as the primary canvas
* Cards remain readable and premium with clear depth separation
* Switching between pages has no background jumps

Notes

* The gradient should be subtle and premium, not loud.
* If needed, add a low-opacity noise texture overlay for richness, but keep it optional.

Deliverable

* One global background definition
* One global application point (AppShell/Layout)
* No per-page overrides unless absolutely necessary
