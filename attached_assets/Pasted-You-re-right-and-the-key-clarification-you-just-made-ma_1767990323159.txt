You’re right — and the key clarification you just made matters:

> **These are not “industry photos.”
> These are “homepage hero images for best-in-class local business websites.”**

That means we stop thinking like stock photo curators and start thinking like **conversion-focused web designers**.

Below is the **final, locked system** to get this right and stop thrashing.

---

# Final Image Standard: Homepage Hero Photography (Best-in-Class)

## What These Images ARE

They are:

* The **hero image** on a top-performing local business website
* Designed to support:

  * Headline
  * Subheadline
  * Primary CTA
* Selling **trust, professionalism, and outcome**

## What These Images Are NOT

They are not:

* Documentary photos
* Training/manual photos
* Action/repair shots
* “Someone working” for the sake of realism

If it wouldn’t appear behind a **big bold headline and a CTA button**, it does not belong here.

---

## The 5 Non-Negotiable Rules (Lock These)

Every image must pass **all five**:

1. **Website-hero framing**

   * Wide (16:9)
   * Clear negative space
   * Subject offset left/right
   * Calm composition

2. **Outcome-oriented**

   * Shows *result* or *confidence*, not labor
   * Comfort > effort
   * Trust > technical skill

3. **Photo-realistic**

   * Real camera look
   * Natural lighting
   * No uncanny AI artifacts
   * No hyper-polish

4. **Industry-obvious in 1 second**

   * Remove text → still identifiable
   * If you hesitate → reject

5. **CTA-compatible**

   * You can imagine:

     > “Get a Free Estimate”
     > “Call Now”
     > “Schedule Service”
   * If the image fights the CTA, it’s wrong

---

## Correct Image Archetype (Use This Mental Model)

> **“This is the image a $5M local business would proudly put at the top of their homepage.”**

Not:

* “This is a guy doing the work”
* “This shows the tool”
* “This proves the job exists”

## Industry-Specific: EXACT What to Use

### Plumbing — Homepage Hero

**Use:**

* Clean residential kitchen or bathroom
* Plumber *present but calm* OR implied
* Homeowner environment looks safe and modern

**Best framing:**

* Plumber standing confidently near sink
* OR clean home with plumber logo truck subtly visible

**DO NOT USE:**

* Under-sink darkness
* Pipes
* Crawling, kneeling, sweating

**Prompt guidance:**

> “Photorealistic homepage hero image for a professional residential plumbing company, clean modern home interior, calm confident plumber present, wide composition, natural light, negative space for headline, website marketing photography”

---

### HVAC — Homepage Hero

**Use:**

* Residential home (seasonal cue helps: snow/sun)
* HVAC technician standing calmly OR homeowner interacting with thermostat
* Comfort implied, not machinery

**Best framing:**

* Home exterior with warm/cool lighting
* OR person adjusting smart thermostat (clean, modern)

**DO NOT USE:**

* Open units
* Wiring
* Mechanical rooms
* Gauges and hoses

**Prompt guidance:**

> “Photorealistic homepage hero image for a residential HVAC company, modern home interior or exterior, person calmly adjusting smart thermostat or technician standing confidently, comfort and reliability, wide composition, natural light, website hero photography”

---

### Dental — Homepage Hero

**Use:**

* Bright, modern dental office
* Team smiling toward camera
* Family-friendly tone

**Best framing:**

* Dentist + hygienist team
* Reception or consultation room
* Clean, welcoming space

**DO NOT USE:**

* Open mouths
* Tools
* Procedures
* Reclined patients

**Prompt guidance:**

> “Photorealistic homepage hero image for a family dental practice, modern dental office, friendly dentist team smiling, welcoming environment, wide composition, natural light, website hero photography”

---

### Landscaping — Homepage Hero

**Use:**

* Finished yard (this is critical)
* Worker present is OK, but secondary
* Beautiful outcome first

**Best framing:**

* Wide backyard
* Clean lawn
* Landscaper standing, not working

**DO NOT USE:**

* Mowing mid-cut
* Dirt, mud
* Shovels, digging

**Prompt guidance:**

> “Photorealistic homepage hero image for a residential landscaping company, finished backyard with manicured lawn, landscaper standing confidently, wide composition, natural light, website hero photography”

---

### Electrician / Mechanic / Roofer (If Applicable)

Same rule:

* **Confidence + environment**
* **Not action**

If it looks like a training manual → reject.

---

## Cropping & Layout Rules (Why Current Images Still Feel Off)

Even a good image fails if cropped wrong.

**Crop rules:**

* Never center the subject
* Leave 30–40% negative space
* Subject slightly left or right
* No heads chopped
* No tight crops

---

## Absolute Kill Test (Use This Every Time)

Before approving an image, ask:

> “If I put
> **‘Trusted Local Experts. Call Today.’**
> over this image — does it feel natural?”

If not → it’s wrong.

---

## Strong Recommendation (This Ends the Problem)

### Best-in-Class Move

Generate **real Arclo demo sites** and use:

* Actual homepage hero screenshots
* Above-the-fold only
* No stock photos at all

That is how you move from:

> “Nice examples”

to:

> **“This product is obviously legit.”**

---

## One Sentence to Lock the Team

> **These images are homepage heroes, not proof-of-work photos.**

If you want, next I can:

* Write **exact prompts** you can drop into an image generator that reliably hit this standard
* Or help you pick **one canonical hero image per industry** so this stops being debated
* Or define a **lint rule** so future images can’t regress

But you’re now aiming at the correct bar.
