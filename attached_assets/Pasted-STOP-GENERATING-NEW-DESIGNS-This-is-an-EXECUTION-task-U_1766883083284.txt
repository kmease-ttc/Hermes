STOP GENERATING NEW DESIGNS.

This is an EXECUTION task.

Use the existing approved CrewCard component EXACTLY as-is:
- Do NOT change size
- Do NOT change borders
- Do NOT change avatar scale
- Do NOT change typography
- Do NOT change badge placement
- Do NOT change shadows/rounding

We are only changing HOW cards are positioned: replace absolute/percent positioning with a fixed grid-based slot layout.

========================================
1) LOCKED DESKTOP GRID (>=1280px)
========================================

Implement a fixed 4 columns × 4 rows grid for ship slots.

Grid rules:
- Grid gap: 28px (both directions)
- Tile size: LOCKED (use the current tile size used in production)
- Cards must NEVER resize based on content
- If a title would wrap, truncate it. Never resize.

Grid placement must follow THIS exact slot map:

Row 1 (Command):
- Col 2: Mission Control (Major Tom) [filled, Included]
- All other columns empty/unused in row 1

Row 2 (Visibility/Intelligence):
- Col 1: Competitive Intelligence (Natasha) [filled if enabled]
- Col 2: SERP Tracking (Lookout) [empty slot if not enabled]
- Col 3: Analytics & Signals (Popular) [empty slot if not enabled]
- Col 4: Analytics & Signals (Popular) [filled if enabled]
NOTE: If you currently show both “Analytics & Signals” and “Popular” as separate, combine them:
- Slot label: “Analytics & Signals”
- Crew card name: “Popular”

Row 3 (Engineering + Content):
- Col 1: Technical SEO (Scotty) [empty if not enabled]
- Col 2: Performance Monitoring (Speedster) [empty if not enabled]
- Col 3: Content Decay (Sentinel) [empty if not enabled]
- Col 4: Content Strategy (Hemingway) [empty if not enabled]

Row 4 (Authority + AI + Growth + Knowledge):
- Col 1: Domain Authority (Beacon) [empty if not enabled]
- Col 2: AI Optimization (Atlas) [empty if not enabled]
- Col 3: Paid Ads (Draper) [empty if not enabled]
- Col 4: Knowledge Base (Socrates) [empty if not enabled]

This guarantees all 12 roles are always visible and fit with no overlap.

========================================
2) EMPTY SLOT CTA STYLING (FULL SIZE)
========================================

Empty slots must render as full-size cards (same width/height) but with CTA styling:
- Dashed border
- Role icon centered
- CTA text: “Add crew”
- Info (i) icon top-left with tooltip describing role
- Clicking empty slot opens the same modal flow to select/enable crew

Empty slots are NOT disabled. They are primary CTAs.

========================================
3) SHIP BACKGROUND IS DECORATIVE ONLY
========================================

The ship interior background image is ONLY decoration:
- It must not control layout
- It must not affect card positioning
- Cards are positioned by the grid only

Implementation:
- Put ship background behind the grid container (absolute inset-0, pointer-events-none)
- Grid container sits above it (relative z-10)

========================================
4) RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
========================================

- Desktop >=1280px: use the fixed 4×4 grid exactly
- Tablet: 2 columns (still ordered by the same slot order)
- Mobile: 1 column stacked, in slot order (Major Tom first, then Row 2 left-to-right, Row 3, Row 4)

========================================
5) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
========================================

- No overlap can ever happen (grid prevents it)
- All 12 roles are always visible simultaneously
- Filled crew shows approved CrewCard component unchanged
- Empty roles show CTA card of same size and open modal on click
- Background stays the same visual, but never controls placement
- No new visuals are generated
- No design changes to cards

This is a strict implementation task. Follow the slot map exactly.
