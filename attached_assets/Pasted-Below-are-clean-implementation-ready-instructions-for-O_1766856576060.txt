Below are **clean, implementation-ready instructions for Option A** — written exactly as something you can hand to Replit and iterate on. This locks Mission Control as the canonical daily workflow while keeping Agents as deep-dive.

---

## Option A — Mission Control (Primary Daily Workflow)

### Objective

Create a single **Mission Control** page that merges the existing Dashboard and Agents functionality into one coherent, action-oriented experience. Mission Control answers three questions, in order:

1. **What’s happening?** (metrics with meaning)
2. **Why is it happening?** (agent intelligence)
3. **What should I do next?** (review / approve / export prompts)

The existing **Agents** page remains, but becomes a drill-down view only.

---

## 1. Navigation & Page Structure

### Navigation changes

* Rename **Dashboard → Mission Control**
* Keep **Agents** in the nav, but position it as secondary
* Mission Control becomes the default landing page after site selection

### Page route

* Reuse `/dashboard` or create `/mission-control`
* UI title must be **Mission Control**

---

## 2. Canonical Data Rule (Non-negotiable)

There must be **one single source of truth** for metrics across:

* Mission Control tiles
* Agent cards (e.g. Pulse / Popular)
* Detail views

### Implementation

* Introduce or enforce a canonical table: `metric_snapshots`
* UI components **must not** call GA4, GSC, etc. directly
* Agents write to `metric_snapshots`
* UI only reads from `metric_snapshots`

### Required fields

* site_id
* metric_key (e.g. `sessions_7d`, `sessions_30d`, `top10_keywords`)
* window_start / window_end
* value
* comparison_value
* delta_abs
* delta_pct
* as_of
* source_agent

If numbers disagree anywhere in the UI, that’s a bug.

---

## 3. Mission Control Layout (Top → Bottom)

### A. Header

* Page title: **Mission Control**
* Subtitle: “Daily diagnostic report for {domain}”
* Actions:

  * Export
  * Run Diagnostics
* Site selector stays global

---

### B. Captain’s Recommendations (Primary Focus)

* Card-based layout (not a flat list)
* Each recommendation is its own card with:

  * Priority number
  * Title
  * One-line “Why”
  * Signals (agent chips)
  * Impact + Effort chips
  * CTA: **Review →**

#### Required behavior

* Clicking Review opens context (drawer or page)
* Captain’s section always shows **exactly 3** priority actions
* Blockers appear in a distinct warning container below

---

### C. Key Outcomes (Big, Visual, Opinionated)

Replace text-heavy dashboard cards with **Outcome Tiles**.

Each tile must show:

* Big number (primary metric)
* Delta vs baseline (7d or 30d)
* Verdict chip: **Good / Watch / Bad**
* One-line reason
* One clear next action (links to agent detail)

#### Required tiles (initial)

* Website Traffic
* Technical SEO
* Keyword Rankings
* Domain Authority
* Conversions (when available)

If a tile shows a number, it MUST also show:

* Is this good or bad?
* By how much?
* What should I do next?

---

### D. Agent Highlights (Compact Strip)

Show a horizontal strip of agents:

* Agent avatar
* Name
* Score
* Status color

Example:
Socrates 85 | Pulse 72 | Scotty 15 | Lookout 68 | Beacon 86

Clicking an agent:

* Navigates to Agents page
* Or opens detail drawer (future-proof)

---

### E. Action Queue (Review → Approve → Export Prompt)

Introduce an **Action Queue** derived from Captain’s Recommendations.

Each item:

* Title
* Source agents
* Impact / Effort
* Status: New | Reviewed | Approved | Done
* Actions:

  * Review
  * Approve
  * Export Prompt

#### Export Prompt

* Generates a downloadable `.md` file
* Contains:

  * Summary
  * Evidence from agents
  * Explicit Replit instructions
  * Acceptance criteria

No executor required yet — this is manual but structured.

---

### F. Benchmarks & Knowledge Base (Visual Placeholders)

These sections should exist even if data is incomplete.

#### Industry Benchmarks

* Visual first (bars, percentiles)
* Minimal text
* Default to psychiatry / healthcare benchmarks
* If unavailable: show muted placeholder + “Run diagnostics”

#### Knowledge Base Insights

* Feed-style cards
* Each insight:

  * Agent source
  * Timestamp
  * Actionable sentence
* Empty state should look intentional, not broken

---

### G. Diagnostic Tickets (De-flattened)

Replace the flat table with **grouped tickets by agent**.

Structure:

* Agent header (icon, name, score, status)
* Under each: compact ticket cards

  * Short title
  * Impact chip
  * Next step
  * Review button

This removes repetition and ties tickets back to agents.

---

## 4. Agents Page (After Merge)

Agents page becomes:

* Deep-dive only
* Full agent cards
* Logs, metrics, diagnostics
* No summary role

Mission Control is the daily driver.

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

Option A is complete when:

* Mission Control replaces Dashboard as primary page
* All metrics match everywhere (single source of truth)
* Every metric shows value + delta + verdict + next step
* Captain’s Recommendations are card-based and scannable
* Users can Review / Approve / Export prompts from one place
* Agents page is clearly secondary, not redundant

---

If you want, next we can:

* Lock exact verdict thresholds
* Design the Review / Approval drawer
* Write the schema for Action Queue + prompt generation
