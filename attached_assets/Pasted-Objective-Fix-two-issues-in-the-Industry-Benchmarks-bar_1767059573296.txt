Objective
Fix two issues in the Industry Benchmarks bars:

1. The white marker dot is vertically misaligned (too low) compared to the Core Web Vitals slider dot.
2. The benchmark bars should use the same **graded/gradient** color treatment as the Core Web Vitals bars (not a flat/solid palette).

Issue 1 — Marker Dot Vertical Alignment (Too Low)
Symptoms

* In the Core Web Vitals cards, the white marker dot sits perfectly centered on the bar.
* In Industry Benchmarks, the same dot appears slightly below the bar.

Root Cause (Most likely)

* The benchmark bar height differs from the Core Vitals bar height, but the marker is positioned with a hardcoded `top` or translate that assumes a different bar thickness.
* OR the dot is positioned relative to the container instead of the actual bar track element.

Required Fix

* Anchor the dot to the **actual track element** and center it vertically using transform math, not magic numbers.

Implementation Guidance (CSS)

* Make the track element `position: relative`.
* Render the dot as an absolutely positioned element inside the track:

  * `position: absolute;`
  * `left: ${pct}%;`
  * `top: 50%;`
  * `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);`
    This guarantees the dot is vertically centered regardless of track height.

Also ensure:

* The dot element is not inheriting line-height or being pushed by flex alignment.
* If the dot is inside a flex row, move it out of the flex flow and into absolute positioning.

Acceptance Criteria

* The dot sits exactly centered on the bar in every benchmark row (LCP, CLS, INP, Performance Score).
* It matches the Core Web Vitals visual positioning.

Issue 2 — Industry Benchmarks Color Palette Should Match Core Web Vitals (Graded / Gradient)
Current

* Industry Benchmarks bars use a simpler segmented palette that doesn’t match the richer graded/gradient look of the Core Web Vitals bars.

Required End State

* Industry Benchmarks bars should use the **same visual grading** as Core Web Vitals:

  * Smooth gradient progression from Good → Needs Work → Poor
  * Same hues/saturation as the Core Vitals track
  * Not a flat “three blocks” look

Implementation Guidance
Option A (Preferred): Reuse the exact Core Web Vitals track component styling

* Extract the track style (or component) used by Core Web Vitals cards into a shared component (or shared CSS token).
* Apply it to BenchmarkPositionBar so both use the same background gradient.

Option B: Match via CSS gradient

* Set track background to a linear-gradient that mirrors the Core Vitals bar:

  * Green section transitions into yellow, then into red
  * Use identical colors already used in Core Vitals (no new colors)
* Keep percentile markers (p25, p50, p75, p90) as labels, but the bar itself should visually grade like Core Vitals.

Important: Percentiles vs Thresholds

* The benchmark bar is percentile-based, not threshold-based, so the gradient does not need to map “good/bad” thresholds precisely—just provide the same graded visual language.
* Still keep p25/p50/p75/p90 labels.

Acceptance Criteria

* Benchmark bars visually match Core Web Vitals bar style (graded/gradient, same palette).
* No new colors introduced.
* The bar looks consistent across all benchmark rows.

Deliverable

* Update `BenchmarkPositionBar` (or equivalent) to:

  1. Fix dot vertical centering (absolute + 50% translate)
  2. Apply the shared Core Vitals gradient styling
* Verify alignment and palette on all benchmark metrics shown on the Speedster page.
