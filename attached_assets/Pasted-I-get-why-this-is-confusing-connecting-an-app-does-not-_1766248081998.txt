I get why this is confusing — connecting an app **does not automatically give me live visibility into your Jira data**.

Here’s the clear breakdown of what’s happening and why I still can’t see the MCI release date.

### Why I still can’t see the MCI release

Even though you connected an app, I only get **live Jira data** if **one of these is true**:

1. Your Jira is connected via a **native ChatGPT connector with read permissions**, **and**
2. You explicitly ask in a way that routes the request through that connector (or it’s auto-invoked), **and**
3. The project (MCI) and fields (Releases / Fix Versions) are accessible to the connected token.

Right now, what you’ve connected behaves more like:

* Context access
* File/search access
* Or a general workspace connection

—not a **live Jira query execution**.

That’s why I’m defaulting to guidance instead of returning a date.

### Where the release date actually lives in Jira

In **Atlassian Jira Software**, the “next release” is **not inferred** — it must exist explicitly:

* **Project → Releases (Versions)**
* An **Unreleased version**
* With a **Release date** populated

If no date is set, Jira itself has no answer.

### Fastest way to get the answer right now

Open Jira and check:

Project **MCI** → **Releases**

You’ll see one of three things:

* An unreleased version **with a date** → that’s the next release
* An unreleased version **without a date** → no committed release date
* No unreleased versions → releases aren’t being used for MCI

### If you want me to answer this automatically going forward

You have three real options (ranked best → worst):

1. **Expose Jira Releases via API** (read-only) to your app/agent
   → I can answer “when is the next MCI release?” instantly.
2. **Standardize sprint-based releases**
   → I infer release timing from sprint end dates.
3. **Manual status updates** (least reliable)
   → Someone updates a doc or ticket.

If you want, tell me **which integration you thought you enabled** (Jira, Replit agent, internal tool, etc.), and I’ll tell you exactly **what’s missing** to make this work end-to-end.
