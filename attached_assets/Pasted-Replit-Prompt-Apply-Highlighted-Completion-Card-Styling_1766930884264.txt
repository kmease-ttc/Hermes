Replit Prompt: Apply “Highlighted Completion” Card Styling (AI Discoverability style) to Mission Control + Crew Summary (color-aware)

Goal
I want to reuse the same visual treatment used on the “AI Discoverability” card in Crew Collaboration (subtle translucent tinted background + slightly stronger border/inner glow) to add contrast in Mission Control—WITHOUT using gold.

Where to apply

1. Mission Control → Key Metrics

* Add a “highlighted” treatment to the Bounce Rate card only (for now).
* Use Bounce Rate’s existing red theme color (not gold).
* Keep the existing chart, layout, values, and badge (Alert) unchanged—just add the subtle tinted background / border treatment.

2. Mission Control → Crew Summary

* Reduce random colors; make each crew summary card theme follow the crew member’s assigned color (Natasha=red, Sentinel=blue, Lookout=pink, etc.)
* Apply the same subtle tinted “highlighted” treatment to the crew summary cards using each crew member’s color.
* The card should still look like the overall glass UI; this is just a soft tinted layer that adds contrast.

Implementation approach (preferred)
A) Extract the styling from the “AI Discoverability” card into a reusable variant

* Find the component that renders the Crew Collaboration cards (the section that includes AI Discoverability).
* Identify the exact Tailwind classes used for the tinted background and border/glow on AI Discoverability.
* Create a small utility or component variant that can be reused:

  * Option 1: <GlassCard variant="highlight" tint="red" .../>
  * Option 2: a helper function that returns className strings based on “tint” and “highlighted”
* The “highlighted” effect should be:

  * A translucent background tint (10–18% opacity) using the tint color
  * A subtle border in the same hue (low opacity)
  * Optional inner glow / soft shadow that is NOT creating a 1px bright artifact
  * Keep corners, padding, typography consistent with existing glass cards

B) Color tokens / mapping

* Define a centralized color mapping for tints used in the UI:

  * bounceRateTint: red (use whatever red is already used for Bounce Rate line/badge)
  * crewTintMap keyed by crew member id/name/role → tint color (Natasha red, Sentinel blue, Lookout pink, etc.)
* Use Tailwind-friendly values (either existing theme tokens or inline via CSS variables).
* If you need flexibility, prefer CSS variables:

  * style={{ "--tint": "96 165 250" }} and use bg-[rgb(var(--tint)/0.12)] style patterns

C) Apply to Bounce Rate (Key Metrics)

* Locate the Key Metrics card component(s).
* Add a prop or conditional for Bounce Rate card to enable highlighted variant:

  * highlighted={true}
  * tint="red"
* Ensure it does not affect Conversion Rate or Leads cards.

D) Apply to Crew Summary (color-aware)

* Locate the Crew Summary rendering (the row of crew member cards).
* For each crew member card:

  * Determine the member’s theme color from the crewTintMap
  * Apply highlighted variant using that tint
  * Keep content layout identical
* Remove any “extra” colors that don’t match the member’s theme (e.g., generic greens/yellows that aren’t tied to that crew member). The card accents should be derived from the member tint.

Visual acceptance criteria

* Bounce Rate Key Metric card has the same “soft filled” contrast treatment as AI Discoverability, but tinted red.
* No gold is introduced anywhere in this change.
* No 1px edge artifacts appear (especially left edges). If any appear, remove divide-x / border-l / inset shadow culprits and use gap-based spacing and symmetric borders.
* Crew Summary cards visually read as “Natasha card is red-themed, Sentinel is blue-themed, Lookout is pink-themed,” etc., without random unrelated colors.
* Everything still feels like the same glass design system.

Deliverables

* Reusable highlight/tint variant (component or utility)
* Bounce Rate updated to use it
* Crew Summary updated to use tint-by-member
* Minimal code churn: don’t refactor unrelated sections

Notes

* Don’t change data, charts, badges, or copy—this is purely a styling/variant change.
