You are a senior frontend engineer working inside this Replit project.

Goal (comprehensive UI standardization)
Make ALL crew pages use ONE consistent design standard for:

1. Key Metrics styling (glass cards) — but the accent/highlight color must match the crew/worker’s color (not a universal purple).
2. Mission widget styling — gold outline + consistent layout + includes the score element everywhere (not just Speedster).
3. Ensure Lookout and any other outliers match the same Missions format.

Crews that MUST be verified and fixed (explicit list)

* Natasha
* Lookout
* Popular
* Scotty
* Speedster
* Sentinel
* Hemingway
* Beacon
* Atlas
* Draper
* Socrates

Non-negotiables

* No per-page copy/paste styling hacks.
* Create/update shared components + a single registry so every crew page renders identically.
* Mission widget must have the same gold outline treatment and internal structure across all crews.
* Mission widget must display the score element consistently for every crew (it is currently missing outside Speedster).
* Key Metrics cards must be glass-styled everywhere, but accent color must match each crew/worker color (Socrates should not be purple if his worker color is green).

Phase 1 — Establish shared design tokens (single source of truth)

1. Create/confirm a Crew UI registry (if it already exists, extend it):

* client/src/crew/crewRegistry.ts (or wherever crew metadata lives)

Add UI theme fields per crew:

* accentColor (hex or tailwind token)  // used by Key Metrics card highlights
* missionAccent (use gold across all crews) // mission widget outline/tint
* iconColor (optional)

Populate accentColor to match each worker’s current brand color used in the left nav icon / crew badge.
Example: Natasha purple, Socrates green, Scotty orange, etc.
Do NOT hardcode colors in components; they must come from the registry.

Phase 2 — Key Metrics: make it consistent but color per crew
2) Update shared Key Metrics components (must be shared):

* KeyMetricsGrid
* KeyMetricCard

Requirements:

* Keep the Speedster/Natasha “glass” layout as the canonical structure (padding, border, shadow, blur).
* Replace “default purple” accent behavior with “accentColor from crew registry”.
* KeyMetricsGrid must accept a prop: accentColor (or crewId and it resolves internally).
* Ensure:

  * border glow
  * top highlight line
  * icon tint
    all use accentColor.

3. Update all crew pages to pass the crewId (or accentColor) to KeyMetricsGrid

* Every crew page should already have crewId available via CrewDashboardShell; use that.
* Ensure Socrates picks up green again (matching his worker color), while Natasha stays purple.

Phase 3 — Missions: unify format + gold outline + score everywhere
4) Identify the shared Missions widget used on crew pages

* There should be exactly ONE shared component, e.g.:

  * client/src/components/missions/MissionsWidget.tsx (or MissionOverview)

5. Enforce the canonical Missions widget format across all crews
   Mission widget requirements (must match Speedster format):

* Gold outline/tint on the mission card container (same as core format)
* Same structure:

  * Title (“Missions” or “Mission Overview”)
  * Status pill
  * “Next:” line
  * NEXT ACTIONS section
  * RECENTLY COMPLETED section (if stubbed, keep it consistent)
* All spacing/typography identical across crews.

6. Add the missing score element to Missions widget for ALL crews

* The score element (the circular score indicator / “Performance score” style element) must show consistently for every crew’s Missions widget, not just Speedster.
* Implement Score display in the shared Missions widget:

  * Accept score prop (number | null)
  * Render it aligned with the mission header area (not vertically centered to the entire card).
  * Use the same gold/yellow styling for the score ring across all crews (this is mission UI, not key metrics).
* Ensure every crew page passes its score to the Missions widget.

  * If score comes from crew header already, reuse the same score source.
  * If score is missing for certain crews, render “—” but keep layout consistent.

7. Fix Lookout specifically (format mismatch)

* Ensure Lookout uses the same MissionsWidget component.
* Remove any bespoke mission rendering and replace with the shared widget.

Phase 4 — Apply to Mission Control (optional if already done)
8) If Mission Control uses missions:

* Ensure it uses the same shared MissionsWidget styling for consistency.
* Keep Blockers unchanged.

Verification checklist (must do before finishing)
For each crew in the explicit list above:

* Open the crew page and verify:

  * Key Metrics show glass cards and accent color matches the crew/worker (Socrates green, Natasha purple, etc.)
  * Missions widget has gold outline/tint
  * Missions widget uses the same layout as Speedster
  * Missions widget shows the score element (or “—” placeholder) with consistent alignment
  * Lookout matches the format (no bespoke layout)
* Provide a short “before/after” confirmation in the final response listing each crew and whether it matches.

Deliverables

* Updated crew registry with accentColor mapping
* Shared KeyMetricsGrid/KeyMetricCard updated to use per-crew accent
* Shared MissionsWidget updated to include score + gold outline consistently
* Confirmation that all listed crews now match the standard
