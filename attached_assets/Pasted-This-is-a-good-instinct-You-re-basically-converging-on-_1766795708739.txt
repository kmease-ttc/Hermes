This is a good instinct. You’re basically converging on **two layers of intelligence** with a single surface:

1. **Agent-level intelligence (what each agent sees + recommends)**
2. **Captain-level synthesis (what Hermes concludes by combining agents)**

You can do this **without creating two pages or two mental models** if you structure the Agents page correctly.

Below is a concrete proposal that maps cleanly to what you described and fits what you already have.

---

## 1. Rename + Reframe the Page

**Rename**

* `Crew Manifest` → **Agents**
* Subtitle: *Your hired specialists working on your site*

This immediately shifts the mental model from “internal system” → “value to me.”

---

## 2. Filter Out Non–End-User Agents

You’re 100% right here.

### Hide entirely from the Agents page

These should exist operationally, but not visually:

* Vault
* Herald (Notifications)
* Internal connectors / infra agents
* Auth, Secrets, Telemetry-only services

Rule of thumb:

> If the agent doesn’t *find*, *analyze*, or *recommend* something the user can act on → it doesn’t appear.

---

## 3. One Agent = One Card = One Line of Value

Each agent card should answer **four questions instantly**:

1. What do you do?
2. What did you find?
3. When did you last run?
4. What should I do next?

### Base Card Structure (all agents)

```
[ Agent Name ]          [ Status ]

What I watch:
- Plain-English scope (1 line)

What I found:
- 1–3 concrete findings (numbers > words)

Last checked:
- Timestamp / relative time

Recommendation:
- One specific next action
```

No tabs. No chips. No internal jargon.

## 4. Example: BlogWriter Agent

Instead of “Writer” or “Blog Writer,” make it outcome-driven.

**BlogWriter**
Status: Healthy / Needs Attention

**What I watch**

* Blog cadence, quality, and topical coverage

**What I found**

* 18 total blog posts
* 6 ranking on page 1
* Last post published 21 days ago

**Last checked**

* 2 hours ago

**Recommendation**

* Write a blog this week targeting:

  * “Telepsychiatry Florida”
  * “ADHD treatment Orlando”
  * “Online psychiatrist without insurance”

This immediately tells the user:

* Is this working?
* Is it stale?
* What should I do *this week*?

---

## 5. Example: Technical SEO (Scotty)

**Scotty – Technical SEO**

**What I watch**

* Crawlability, rendering, and index health

**What I found**

* 14 pages blocked by robots.txt
* 3 pages failing JS render
* 2 orphaned high-value pages

**Last checked**

* 1 hour ago

**Recommendation**

* Fix blocked pages:

  * `/psychiatrist-orlando`
  * `/telepsychiatry`
* Re-render JS on blog templates

---

## 6. Example: Domain Authority / Backlinks (Beacon)

**Beacon – Authority & Backlinks**

**What I watch**

* Domain authority and link growth

**What I found**

* Domain Authority: 28 (+2 this month)
* 5 new backlinks this week
* 2 links from low-quality domains

**Last checked**

* 30 minutes ago

**Recommendation**

* Disavow 2 spam domains
* Acquire 3 local healthcare links

---

## 7. Introduce “Captain’s Recommendations” (Without a New Page)

This is the second concept you’re circling, and it’s the right one.

### Where it lives

**Top of the Agents page**, above the agent list.

### What it is

A **synthesis panel** powered by Hermes that only exists *because* multiple agents exist.

Label it clearly as different:

**Captain’s Recommendations**
*Insights based on 6 active agents*

### What it contains (max 3 items)

Each item should:

* Reference multiple agents implicitly
* Be higher-order than any single agent

**Example**

**Priority Actions This Week**

1. Publish a new blog on “Telepsychiatry Florida”

   * Blog cadence is slipping (BlogWriter)
   * Keyword demand is rising (SERP Analyst)
   * Pages are technically healthy (Scotty)

2. Fix indexing on `/psychiatrist-orlando`

   * High conversion page (GA4)
   * Currently blocked from crawl (Technical SEO)

3. Acquire 2 local backlinks

   * Authority growth has plateaued (Beacon)
   * Local competitors gained links this month

This is where “the more agents you hire, the smarter the system gets” becomes obvious without you ever saying it.

---

## 8. Intelligence Scales With Agent Count (Implicitly)

You don’t need to explain this explicitly in UI.

It becomes obvious because:

* Captain’s Recommendations only appear if ≥2 agents
* Recommendations get richer as more agents contribute
* A single agent = only that agent’s card, no synthesis

You can subtly reinforce it with copy:

> *Captain’s Recommendations improve as more agents are active.*

---

## 9. Implementation Notes (Important)

* **Do not show raw metrics unless they answer a question**
* **Never show empty cards** — if an agent has no data, show:

  * “No findings yet” + “Run first scan”
* **Recommendations must always exist**, even if simple:

  * “Keep monitoring”
  * “No action needed this week”

---

## 10. Net Result

You end up with:

* One page
* One mental model
* Clear user value
* Clear differentiation from “SEO dashboards”
* A natural path to upsell more agents without selling

If you want, next step we can:

* Redesign the exact card layout (visual hierarchy)
* Define the data contract each agent must return
* Write the Hermes synthesis rules for Captain’s Recommendations
