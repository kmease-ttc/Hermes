Objective
Use **Speedster as the gold-standard reference dashboard** and systematically refactor **every crew dashboard** so they all follow the same data, layout, mission, and interaction model. This is a **repeatable, long-running refactor prompt** intended for Replit to execute crew-by-crew until all dashboards are aligned.

Speedster is the canonical example. Natasha may be partially complete but should still be validated against this spec.

GLOBAL RULES (Apply to ALL Crew Dashboards)

These rules apply before touching any individual crew.

1. Speedster Is the Reference Implementation

* Treat the current Speedster dashboard as the correct, final model.
* Do not invent new patterns per crew.
* Other dashboards must conform to Speedster’s structure, density, and polish.

2. Fix Data First, Then UI
   For every crew:

* Verify API/worker integration works.
* Fetch real data and store it.
* Render real data (or last snapshot).
* Only then clean up widgets and layout.

No dashboard should look “finished” while showing mock or broken data.

3. Resilience Is Mandatory

* If live API fails, show last snapshot.
* If data does not exist, show a clear “Missing from API” message listing missing fields.
* Never render empty cards silently.

---

STANDARD DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (All Crews)

Each crew dashboard must follow this exact order:

1. Unified Crew Top Section (Single Widget)
2. Mission Status
3. Missions
4. Crew-Specific Metrics / Cards
5. Benchmarks / Comparisons (if applicable)
6. Inspector / Details (if applicable)

No duplicated headers. No floating widgets.

---

1. UNIFIED CREW TOP SECTION (MANDATORY)

This must be ONE cohesive widget.

Contents:

* Crew avatar / character (make it slightly larger than current default)
* Crew name
* Crew role / specialty
* Crew monitors / capabilities (pills or chips)
* Primary actions (crew-specific)
* Embedded “Ask [CrewName]” input (inline, not a separate widget)

Rules:

* Remove any standalone “Ask [CrewName]” widgets.
* Ask input must be embedded at the bottom of this top section:

  * Left: “Ask [CrewName]”
  * Right: input field + send icon
* Do NOT show a score here (score belongs in Mission Status only).
* Use available horizontal space; this section should feel substantial and intentional.

---

2. MISSION STATUS (STANDARDIZED)

Mission Status answers: **“How are we doing overall?”**

Required:

* Left: Composite Score (0–100), styled like Speedster
* Center: Plain-English status summary (Healthy / Needs Attention / Critical)
* Right: Single CTA → “Fix Everything”

Rules:

* Score is computed from:

  * % missions completed
  * number/severity of blockers
  * severity of remaining missions
* No task-level actions here.
* No “go to next mission.”
* This is the executive summary.

---

3. MISSIONS (MANUAL / EXPERT MODE)

Missions are for **approving work one-by-one**.

General Rules:

* Button text must be **“Fix it”** (not “Start”, not “Run”).
* Missions must look like clean cards, not tag clouds.
* Do NOT duplicate Action Queue (Action Queue is removed everywhere).

Mission Card Structure (Exactly This):

A) Title Row

* Strong mission title
* Optional single contextual metric (right-aligned)

B) Description

* One sentence explaining *why* this matters

C) Bottom Metadata Row (MAX 3 items)

* Impact (High / Medium / Low) → visual indicator, not text tag
* Estimated Effort (Quick / Medium / Long) → icon or subtle label
* Crew ownership → avatars/icons only (no name pills)

Remove:

* “Needs setup” tags
* Redundant impact/priority tags
* Excessive chips/pills

Blockers:

* Keep blockers as-is.
* Blockers must remain visually distinct from missions.

---

4. CREW-SPECIFIC METRICS & CARDS

Use Speedster as the quality bar:

* Polished cards
* Clear hierarchy
* Gradients where appropriate
* Marker alignment correct
* No duplicated metric stacks

If the crew has:

* Primary metrics → show them as cards
* Benchmarks → include visual position bars (like Speedster Industry Benchmarks)

If metrics are missing:

* Explicitly say what is missing from the API.

---

5. BENCHMARKS (IF APPLICABLE)

Rules:

* Use the same gradient palette as Speedster (Good → Needs Work → Poor).
* Marker dots must be vertically centered on the bar.
* Benchmarks must visually match Speedster’s polish.

---

6. CLEANUP & CONSISTENCY RULES

Apply everywhere:

* Remove duplicate widgets.
* Remove mock-only sections once real data exists.
* Use consistent spacing and card density.
* Do not introduce new UI patterns.

Navigation:

* Refresh / Fix / Run actions must NOT redirect the user to another crew.
* Remain on the active crew page after every action.

---

EXECUTION STRATEGY (HOW REPLIT SHOULD RUN THIS)

Process crews one at a time in this order:

1. Speedster (reference — already done, just verify)
2. Natasha (validate and fix regressions)
3. Each remaining crew, sequentially

For EACH crew:

* Print crew name
* Execute the full checklist above
* Verify:

  * Data loads
  * Mission Status score renders
  * Missions look clean
  * Ask is embedded
  * No duplicate widgets
* Move to next crew

---

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (GLOBAL)

* All crew dashboards visually and structurally match Speedster.
* All dashboards show real data or clear missing-data messages.
* Mission Status includes a score everywhere.
* Missions use “Fix it” consistently.
* Ask is embedded into the top section everywhere.
* No Action Queue anywhere.
* The app feels cohesive, intentional, and production-ready.

---

This prompt is intended to run **continuously** until every crew dashboard conforms to the Speedster model.
