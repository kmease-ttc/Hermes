You are a senior frontend engineer polishing the **Tasks** section of the Mission Control dashboard. The content is correct, but the section is missing **visual emphasis and alignment precision**.

Your task is to:

1. Add a **gold / amber glow border** to the Tasks container
2. Fix the **alignment and hierarchy of the “25” circle indicator** so it feels intentional, centered, and readable

This is a **UI-only change**. Do not modify task logic or data.

---

## PART 1 — Add a gold / amber border + glow to the Tasks section

### Goal

Tasks represent **attention-required actions**, so the entire Tasks container must visually communicate:

> “This needs action.”

### Implementation

Apply the same glow/border treatment used in **Key Metrics**, but with **gold / amber tokens** instead of purple.

#### Tasks container styling requirements:

* Rounded corners (match Key Metrics radius)
* Subtle gold/amber border
* Soft outward glow (not harsh)
* Glass background remains unchanged

Example (conceptual):

* Border color: amber / gold
* Glow: low opacity, large blur radius
* No solid fills, no gradients

⚠️ Do NOT:

* Add shadows that make it feel heavy
* Use green
* Increase contrast too much

This section should feel *important*, not alarming.

---

## PART 2 — Fix alignment of the “25” circle indicator

### Current problem

* The “25” circle feels slightly misaligned vertically
* It visually competes with the “Next:” text instead of anchoring it
* It feels like a floating badge, not a structured part of the layout

### Target behavior

The “25” indicator should:

* Act as a **visual anchor**
* Be vertically centered relative to the “Next” row
* Feel intentionally paired with “Next: Complete Fetch Analytics”

---

### Correct layout structure

Wrap the **Next Action row** in a horizontal flex container:

```
[ 25-circle ]  [ Next: Complete Fetch Analytics ]           [ 25 open ]
```

#### Requirements:

* Parent container: `flex items-center`
* Circle:

  * Fixed size (e.g. 40–44px)
  * `flex items-center justify-center`
  * Text perfectly centered
* Text block:

  * Left-aligned
  * Vertically centered relative to the circle
* Right-side “25 open”:

  * Vertically aligned with the row
  * Slightly muted color

Add consistent horizontal spacing:

* Gap between circle and text: ~12–16px

---

### Visual hierarchy tweak (important)

* Make the “25” circle slightly **less dominant** than the “Next Action” text
* The user should read:

  1. “Next: Complete Fetch Analytics”
  2. Then notice “25” as context

This prevents the number from feeling shouty.

---

## PART 3 — Small but important polish

### A) Vertical spacing

* Add a bit more padding above and below the “Next” row
* This visually separates it from the task list below

### B) Consistency check

After changes:

* The Tasks section should visually “match” Key Metrics in quality
* Gold glow should be obvious but tasteful
* The “25” indicator should feel locked into place, not floating

---

## ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

Before marking done, verify:

* Tasks container has a gold/amber glow border
* Glow strength matches Key Metrics (just color-changed)
* “25” circle is vertically centered with the “Next” row
* Spacing between circle, text, and right-side count feels even
* Nothing looks accidentally misaligned when resizing the window

If the Tasks section now *feels* like:

> “This is where I should act next”

…then it’s correct.

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLE

> **Attention sections deserve visual gravity. Alignment creates trust.**

This small fix will make the Tasks section feel finished and deliberate.
