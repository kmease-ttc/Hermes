Replit Prompt: Apply “Blockers” Cold Glass Panel Styling to the “Missions” Priority Actions area (Mission Control)

Clarification / Scope
Only update the “Missions” section inside Mission Control — specifically the “Priority Actions” cards/rows. Do NOT restyle the entire Mission Control page.

Current state

* The “Blockers” panel already has the correct cold glass / contained panel styling.
* The “Priority Actions” area (the mission cards 1/2/3) is not using that same contained style.

Goal
Make the “Priority Actions” area use the exact same cold glass panel/container styling as “Blockers” so it feels contained, readable, and consistent.

What to change

1. Wrap “Priority Actions” in the same container component/variant used by Blockers

* Identify the component/variant used for the Blockers container (likely a Card/Panel variant).
* Reuse that exact variant for the Priority Actions container.
* The “Missions” header area can stay as-is; this is about the inner content region.

2. Apply the same item-row/card styling pattern

* Each mission action card/row (1/2/3) should use the same surface/border treatment rules used inside Blockers:

  * clear dark glass surface
  * subtle border
  * consistent padding + radius
  * readable text + muted subtext

3. Ensure it feels “contained”

* The Priority Actions region should visually read like a single module (like Blockers):

  * consistent internal spacing
  * no floating cards that feel disconnected
  * optional: a subtle divider line between items (same as used elsewhere)

Do not change

* Do not change content, copy, tags, or ordering.
* Do not change metrics colors or tag colors in this pass.
* Do not change other Mission Control sections (Key Metrics, Crew Summary, etc.).

Acceptance criteria

* If I compare “Blockers” and “Priority Actions,” they feel like siblings: same cold glass container, same density, same readability.
* The Priority Actions cards no longer look like a separate style system; they look like they belong inside the same module language as Blockers.
