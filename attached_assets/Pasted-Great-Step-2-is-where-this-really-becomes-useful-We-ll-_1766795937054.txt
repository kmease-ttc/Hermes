Great — Step 2 is where this really becomes **useful**. We’ll lock the **agent card contract** and make every card answer the same questions, with **3 numbered next steps**, exactly as you asked.

I’ll keep this **implementation-ready** and aligned with what you already have in Hermes.

---

## STEP 2 — Redesign Agent Cards (Findings + 1-2-3 Next Steps)

### Goal of Step 2

Every **agent card** should:

* Explain its value in plain English
* Show **what it found**
* Show **when it last ran**
* Provide **three numbered next steps (1, 2, 3)**

No dashboards. No jargon. No scrolling into logs.

---

## 2.1 Lock the Agent Response Contract (Critical)

Every **user-visible agent** must return this shape (Hermes can normalize if needed):

```ts
interface AgentInsight {
  agent_id: string;
  agent_name: string;
  role: string;

  watch_description: string;

  findings: {
    label: string;
    value: string | number;
  }[];

  last_run_at: string; // ISO

  next_steps: {
    step: 1 | 2 | 3;
    action: string;
    reason?: string;
  }[];
}
```

**Rules**

* `findings`: max **3**
* `next_steps`: **always exactly 3**
* If data is missing → still populate next steps with defaults

---

## 2.2 Canonical Agent Card Layout (Final)

This replaces the current “Service / Status / Metrics” table row for user-facing agents.

### Visual Hierarchy (Top → Bottom)

```
[ Agent Name ] — Role                 [ Status ]

What I watch
• One plain-English sentence

What I found
• Metric 1
• Metric 2
• Metric 3

Last checked
• Relative timestamp

Next steps
1. Action
2. Action
3. Action
```

One card = one screen row. No expansion required.

## 2.3 Example: BlogWriter (Merged Writer + Quality)

**BlogWriter — Content & Quality**

**What I watch**
Blog publishing cadence, content quality, and topical coverage.

**What I found**

* 18 total blog posts
* 6 ranking on page 1
* Last post published 21 days ago

**Last checked**
2 hours ago

**Next steps**

1. Publish a new blog this week targeting “Telepsychiatry Florida”
2. Refresh 2 older posts that are ranking positions 6–10
3. Add internal links from service pages to recent blogs

---

## 2.4 Example: Scotty — Technical SEO

**Scotty — Technical SEO**

**What I watch**
Crawlability, indexing, and render health.

**What I found**

* 14 URLs blocked by robots.txt
* 3 pages failing JS render
* 2 orphaned high-value pages

**Last checked**
1 hour ago

**Next steps**

1. Unblock `/psychiatrist-orlando` and `/telepsychiatry`
2. Fix JS rendering on blog templates
3. Add internal links to orphaned pages

---

## 2.5 Example: Beacon — Authority & Backlinks

**Beacon — Domain Authority**

**What I watch**
Backlink growth and domain authority trends.

**What I found**

* Domain Authority: 28 (+2 this month)
* 5 new backlinks in last 7 days
* 2 low-quality links detected

**Last checked**
30 minutes ago

**Next steps**

1. Disavow 2 low-quality referring domains
2. Acquire 2 local healthcare backlinks
3. Monitor competitor link growth weekly

---

## 2.6 Fallback Behavior (Important)

If an agent:

* hasn’t run
* has missing credentials
* returned no data

**Do NOT show empty cards.**

Instead:

**What I found**

* No data collected yet

**Next steps**

1. Connect required credentials
2. Run first scan
3. Review results after completion

This keeps the page consistent and honest.

---

## 2.7 Mapping This to Your Current UI (Minimal Disruption)

### What stays

* Status (Ready / Failed / Needs Config)
* Last run timestamp
* Health checks

### What goes away (for user-facing agents)

* “Metrics / Missing / Actions” columns
* Raw smoke test messages
* Endpoint-level errors

Those move to **Diagnostics**, not Agents.

---

## 2.8 What You’ll Have After Step 2

* Agents page becomes **actionable**
* Every agent answers the same 4 questions
* Clear weekly priorities per agent
* Perfect foundation for Step 3 (Captain’s Recommendations)

---

### Next

When you’re ready, say **“Step 3”** and we’ll:

* Define Hermes’ synthesis logic
* Create ranked, cross-agent recommendations
* Make the system feel *intelligent*, not just automated
