Yes. Now that it’s one-per-line, you can make it feel **clean, calm, and scannable** with a few targeted UI changes (no new features, just polish). Here’s a Replit prompt that focuses on “reduce noise, improve hierarchy.”

### Replit Prompt: Polish the Agents Page (Single-Column, Clean + Scannable)

Improve the visual design of the single-column Agents page so each agent card is easier to scan and feels less “data dense,” while keeping all the same information and logic.

Requirements:

* Do not change what data is shown, only improve layout, spacing, typography, and hierarchy.
* Keep the single-column layout (one agent per row, full width).
* Maintain the existing card sections:

  * What I Watch
  * What I Found
  * Last Checked
  * Next Steps (1, 2, 3)

Design updates to implement:

1. Tighten the header area

* Make agent name + role visually stronger and more compact.
* Put agent name on the left, status pill on the right (already), but reduce wasted vertical space.
* Reduce the size of the left icon slightly or soften it (lower opacity background).

2. Improve section hierarchy

* Make section labels (“WHAT I WATCH”, “WHAT I FOUND”, “LAST CHECKED”, “NEXT STEPS”) smaller and lighter (uppercase, muted), but increase spacing between sections so the eye can rest.
* Ensure the body text under each label is readable and not cramped.

3. Make “What I Found” easier to scan

* Convert the findings list into a clean 2-column key/value layout:

  * Left column: label (muted)
  * Right column: value (slightly bolder)
* Align values vertically and keep consistent spacing between rows.
* Keep the list to the existing number of findings; just present them better.

4. Make Next Steps feel like actions (not clutter)

* Keep the 1/2/3 badges, but reduce their visual weight slightly (smaller badge, softer background).
* Add a bit more line spacing between steps so they don’t feel jammed together.

5. Reduce heavy borders / visual noise

* Soften the colored left border: make it thinner OR reduce saturation so it doesn’t dominate.
* Keep the color coding, but make it feel like an accent, not a frame.
* Slightly increase border radius and use a subtle shadow for separation instead of strong borders.

6. Improve whitespace + card rhythm

* Increase internal padding slightly (especially around sections).
* Add consistent vertical spacing between cards (e.g., `space-y-6`).

Acceptance criteria:

* Cards read like a short report, not a dashboard.
* The eye can quickly scan: Name → Status → 3 Findings → 3 Next Steps.
* Everything is calmer with less “shouting,” but still clear.

Implementation guidance:

* Make changes in the AgentCard component (and any shared typography styles it uses).
* Avoid major refactors; this is purely styling/layout polish.

After implementing, preview the Agents page and ensure Socrates/Natasha/Scotty/Beacon all look clean and consistent.

If you want one more “wow” polish after that: add a very subtle divider line between sections inside the card (thin muted border) so the sections feel structured without adding clutter.
