Replit Prompt: Normalize Crew Accent Colors (Brightness/Contrast Consistency) — Replace Natasha Red + Improve Scotty Contrast

Problem
Crew cards are now single-accent and cohesive, but Natasha and Scotty’s accents are too muted compared to Popular, Lookout, Speedster, and Sentinel. They read lower-contrast and lower “energy,” and Natasha’s red isn’t desired going forward.

Goal

1. Replace Natasha’s accent color with a non-red option.
2. Improve Scotty’s accent contrast.
3. Normalize all crew accent colors so they sit at the same perceived brightness level (consistent visual weight across cards, pills, score numbers, progress bars, and subtle top borders).

Design requirements

* All crew accent colors must have similar perceived brightness on the dark glass background.
* Accents should pop like Lookout/Sentinel/Popular without becoming neon.
* Keep semantic colors reserved:

  * Red stays for negative deltas (-12%) and error states only.
  * Gold stays for attention/queue elements (Priority Actions / Watch / Blockers containers where applicable).
* Crew accents are for identity + ownership, not severity.

Implementation steps

1. Centralize crew colors + add “normalized” variants

* Update the single source of truth crew color map (e.g., client/src/lib/crewColors.ts).
* For each crew member define:

  * accent: the primary crew hue (used for score, progress, primary pill accent)
  * accentSoft: a softer tint for backgrounds (highlighted soft fill, soft borders)
  * accentBorder: low-opacity border/glow value
* Prefer using CSS variables so you can tune brightness consistently:

  * --crew-accent-rgb
  * --crew-accent-soft (same rgb with lower alpha)
  * --crew-accent-border (same rgb with very low alpha)

2. Pick new Natasha color (non-red) at matched brightness
   Choose ONE of these directions (keep whichever fits your palette best):

* Electric Violet (distinct from global purple CTA but more “magenta-violet” to feel character-specific)
* Teal/Cyan (high contrast, “techy,” distinct from Sentinel blue)
* Amber/Orange (NOT gold; more orange than yellow so it stays distinct from priority/actions gold)

Important: whichever is chosen, tune it so it visually pops like Lookout/Sentinel (same perceived brightness).

3. Improve Scotty contrast

* Keep Scotty’s hue direction (if it’s currently blue/teal-ish), but increase brightness/saturation so it matches the others.
* Ensure:

  * Scotty’s score number is as legible as Popular’s.
  * Scotty’s progress bar fill is not muddy/dim.
  * Scotty’s “Watch” (or equivalent CTA accent) is clearly visible.

4. Add a “contrast normalizer” helper
   Implement a small helper that applies consistent styling rules to accents:

* Text accents: use a stronger alpha / brighter token
* Bars: use solid accent
* Soft fills: use accent at ~10–16% opacity
* Borders: use accent at ~20–30% opacity
  This prevents one crew member from accidentally using a soft tint where another uses a solid accent.

5. Verify across the exact UI elements
   After updating tokens, verify these are consistent for every crew member:

* Top-right score number
* Progress bar fill
* Crew name pill (if used)
* Watch/primary pill accent
* Optional top border accent

Acceptance criteria

* Popular, Lookout, Speedster, Sentinel, Natasha, Scotty all feel equally “bright” and readable on the dark glass UI.
* Natasha is no longer red, and red is reserved for negative deltas and errors only.
* Scotty no longer looks muted compared to others.
* No page-specific tweaks: only update the centralized crew color system and let it propagate everywhere.
