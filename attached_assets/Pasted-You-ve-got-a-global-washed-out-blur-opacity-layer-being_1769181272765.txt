You’ve got a global “washed out / blur / opacity” layer being applied across the whole app (dashboard and marketing). This is not a component styling issue anymore — it’s almost certainly one of these:
	1.	a paywall blur overlay that is stuck “on”
	2.	a modal/backdrop state that never cleared
	3.	a global CSS rule like body { opacity: … } or filter: blur(...)
	4.	an element wrapping the app with opacity-* / blur-* Tailwind classes

Here’s the fastest way to find and fix it.

⸻

Step 1 — Confirm it’s a CSS filter/opacity (10 seconds)

Open DevTools in the preview (right-click → Inspect).
Click the <body> element.

Look at Computed styles:
	•	opacity
	•	filter
	•	backdrop-filter

If you see anything like:
	•	opacity: 0.2–0.7
	•	filter: blur(...)
	•	backdrop-filter: blur(...)

That’s the culprit.

⸻

Step 2 — The usual culprit in your codebase

Given your earlier paywall design (“blur the report content behind overlay”), the most likely bug is:

✅ You blurred a parent container (App root) instead of the report section container.

That would blur:
	•	marketing site
	•	dashboard
	•	everything

What to search for in code

Use global search for these strings:
	•	blur
	•	backdrop-blur
	•	opacity-
	•	filter:
	•	backdropFilter
	•	pointer-events-none
	•	select-none
	•	paywall
	•	locked
	•	isSubscribed
	•	hasUsedFreeReport

You’re looking for something applied to:
	•	<App />
	•	<Layout />
	•	<main />
	•	<body />

⸻

Step 3 — Fix pattern (this is the correct implementation)

A blur paywall must only wrap the content being gated, not the entire page.

✅ Correct structure

<div className="relative">
  <div className={locked ? "blur-sm pointer-events-none select-none" : ""}>
    {/* ONLY the gated section */}
  </div>

  {locked && (
    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center">
      {/* overlay CTA */}
    </div>
  )}
</div>

❌ Incorrect (what you likely have)

<div className={locked ? "blur-sm" : ""}>
  {/* whole app */}
</div>

If the locked boolean is true even once at the top-level, your whole UI washes out.

⸻

Step 4 — Where to look first (based on your project)

Start here:
	1.	src/App.tsx
	2.	src/main.tsx
	3.	src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx
	4.	the paywall component / gating wrapper (whatever shows the overlay)

Specifically, check if any of these contain:
	•	blur-*
	•	opacity-*
	•	bg-white/… overlays
	•	a div with fixed inset-0 that has opacity and never unmounts

⸻

Step 5 — Quick “hard reset” test (to prove it’s paywall state)

Temporarily force locked = false wherever the blur is applied.

Example:

const locked = false; // TEMP

If the app instantly looks normal again → you found it.

Then fix it properly by:
	•	moving blur down to only the gated panel
	•	ensuring the locked boolean is scoped correctly

⸻

Step 6 — Sidebar color mismatch

Once the blur is fixed, your remaining UI mismatch will be normal component styling.

But right now, don’t touch colors until blur is gone — blur/opacity ruins contrast measurement.

⸻

If you want the fastest possible assist

Tell me what file the paywall/lock logic lives in, OR paste the code around where you apply:
	•	blur-sm / opacity-
	•	the paywall overlay

And I’ll tell you exactly what line to change.

If you don’t know where it is: open src/App.tsx and search for blur first.
