SHIP CANVAS LAYOUT FIX (MAKE IT TALL + RECTANGLE + FULL-HEIGHT TO NEXT SECTION)

Goal:
The ship section must be a tall rectangular canvas that fills the entire right-side area from the top of the page down to the start of the “Active Capabilities” / “Set Bonuses” section. No big empty space below the ship. The ship must extend down the page and use the vertical real estate.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
1) The ship container MUST be a rectangle (not an oval panel).
   - Remove the oval “bubble” background style.
   - Use a full-width rectangular canvas with subtle vignette/background texture.

2) The ship canvas must consume ALL the vertical space above the lower cards:
   - The page should be structured as:
     Row 1 (top): MissionStatus (left) + ShipCanvas (right)
     Row 2 (below): Active Capabilities + Set Bonuses
   - The ShipCanvas container height should match the MissionStatus card height (and ideally exceed it) so the entire top row is “ship dominated.”
   - Set the ShipCanvas container height to a fixed range that guarantees it reaches the next section:
     - min-height: 720px
     - height: calc(100vh - headerHeight - topPadding) (clamped)
     - max-height: 980px
   - The result: the ship canvas rectangle should visually run down to the next section with no large empty gap.

3) Ship silhouette inside the rectangle:
   - Keep the ship hull silhouette centered inside the rectangular canvas.
   - Scale the hull vertically so it occupies most of the rectangle height (not a small ship floating at the top).
   - Reposition crew tiles to fill the hull top-to-bottom.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
A) Update the Crew page layout:
- Wrap the entire top area (MissionStatus + ShipCanvas) in a grid row container.
- Place the lower sections (Active Capabilities / Set Bonuses) in a separate section BELOW.

B) ShipCanvas wrapper styles (RIGHT column):
- Replace current wrapper with:
  - class: w-full rounded-3xl border border-white/10 bg-white/5
  - BUT make it tall:
    - min-h-[720px]
    - lg:h-[calc(100vh-180px)]   (adjust 180px as needed for your header + spacing)
    - max-h-[980px]
- Ensure overflow-hidden so the rectangular canvas feels intentional.

C) Remove any extra “ship-only” margin/padding that creates dead space below.

D) Tile layout:
- Increase vertical spacing between rows by ~15% so the crew fills the taller hull.
- Keep Major Tom at top and make him slightly larger or visually distinct.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- The ship area is a tall rectangle that visually extends down to the “Active Capabilities / Set Bonuses” section.
- No large empty space between ship and the next cards.
- Ship hull and crew tiles are scaled/repositioned to use the full vertical canvas.
- The oval background/shape is removed; the canvas is rectangular.
