Yep — you’re right. What you’re seeing now is **exactly what happens when images are “technically correct” but not “marketing correct.”** This is a *very fixable* issue, and it’s important to get right because examples are doing **trust work**, not decoration.

Below are **very explicit, copy-ready instructions** for your dev team to fix this properly.

# Fix Example Images — Make Them Website-Marketing Friendly

## Problem Summary (What’s Wrong Right Now)

The current images feel **weird / off** because they violate 3 core marketing rules:

1. **They look like generic stock scenes**, not websites
2. **They don’t communicate “this is a finished business site”**
3. **They distract instead of reinforcing credibility**

Examples:

* Cartoonish or staged people
* Isolated objects (e.g., HVAC unit only)
* Medical imagery that feels clinical, not customer-facing
* No sense of *brand*, *layout*, or *conversion intent*

These images feel like **placeholders**, not proof.

---

## What These Images Must Communicate Instead

Each image must instantly say:

> “This is what your business website could look like.”

Not:

> “This is a random photo related to your industry.”

So we are **not** looking for:

* Technicians at work
* Tools
* Equipment
* Medical procedures
* Landscapers with shovels

We **are** looking for:

* Finished websites
* Hero sections
* Business marketing visuals
* Clean, modern, customer-facing imagery

---

## Correct Image Strategy (Use This)

### ✅ The Only Images We Should Use

There are **two acceptable image types**. Pick ONE and be consistent.

---

### **Option A (BEST): Website Mockups / Screenshots**

**This is the ideal solution.**

Use:

* Real screenshots of generated Arclo sites
* Or high-quality website mockups shown on desktop/laptop screens

Examples:

* A plumbing website hero with headline + CTA
* A dental clinic homepage layout
* A landscaping service homepage with service cards

**Why this works:**

* Zero ambiguity
* Feels real
* Instantly communicates value
* No uncanny stock-photo energy

**Implementation:**

* Generate 1–2 real sites per industry
* Screenshot above-the-fold hero sections
* Crop to 16:9
* Use those screenshots as the card images

If you do *nothing else*, do this.

---

### **Option B (Acceptable Fallback): “Marketing Hero” Photos**

If screenshots aren’t ready yet, images must look like **website hero photography**, not stock scenes.

#### Image Requirements (Strict)

Images must:

* Be **clean, bright, neutral**
* Have **negative space** (room for text overlays)
* Look like they belong on a homepage hero
* Feature environments, not actions

#### Industry-Specific Guidance

**Plumbing**

* Exterior of a clean residential home
* Friendly technician standing *still*, smiling, neutral background
* No cartoonish expressions, no action shots

**HVAC**

* Modern home exterior
* Subtle HVAC presence (not close-up unit photos)
* Clean, premium residential feel

**Dental**

* Modern dental office lobby or reception
* Dentist smiling *at camera*, not working
* No masks, no procedures, no open mouths

**Landscaping**

* Finished yard / backyard / patio
* Wide, beautiful result shots
* No crews, no shovels, no dirt

**Rule of thumb:**

> If the image could appear on a business homepage hero, it’s acceptable.

---

## What to Explicitly Avoid (Blacklist)

Do **not** use images with:

* Cartoon characters
* Exaggerated facial expressions
* Isolated equipment
* Medical procedures
* Heavy action shots
* Overly dramatic lighting
* Logos or visible brand names
* “Stock model smiling at clipboard” vibes

If an image makes you laugh, cringe, or squint — it’s wrong.

---

## Card Layout Fix (Very Important)

### Current Problem

The images dominate visually but don’t anchor meaning.

### Required Layout Change

Add **contextual framing** so images feel intentional.

#### Required Overlay

* Subtle dark gradient at bottom of image
* Industry name appears **on image**, not only below

Example:

```
[ Image ]
Plumbing Website · Austin, TX
-----------------------------
Austin Pro Plumbers
Plumbing · Austin, TX
View demo →
Generate like this
```

This visually anchors the image as a **website preview**, not a photo.

---

## Technical Specs (Lock These)

* Aspect ratio: **16:9**
* Min width: **1600px**
* Crop: **center-weighted**
* Object-fit: `cover`
* Border radius: same as card
* Lazy load enabled
* Alt text:

  * “Plumbing business website example”
  * “Dental clinic website homepage example”

---

## Short-Term Fix Plan (Fast)

**Phase 1 (Immediate – today):**

* Remove current weird images
* Replace with neutral website hero-style photos
* Add overlay label (“Plumbing Website”, etc.)

**Phase 2 (Next):**

* Generate 1 real Arclo site per industry
* Replace photos with actual screenshots
* Never go back to stock imagery

---

## Success Criteria

This is fixed when:

* Cards feel like **portfolio pieces**
* Nothing feels “stocky”
* You’d be proud to show this page to a customer
* The examples page sells *confidence*, not creativity

---

## Internal Rule Going Forward

> **Examples are proof, not decoration.**
> If an image doesn’t increase trust, it doesn’t belong.

If you want, next I can:

* Define **exact screenshot framing rules**
* Help generate **real demo sites fast**
* Write a **QA checklist** so this never regresses

But your instinct here is 100% correct — fixing this matters.
