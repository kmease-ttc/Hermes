You are a senior frontend engineer + design-system owner working inside this Replit project. The Scan Preview / report page is improved, but it is still NOT consistently applying the intended brand + glass design system. Fix the inconsistencies below.

DO NOT change scan logic or data. This is UI/layout/theme only.

## PRIMARY ISSUES TO FIX (from Kevin’s feedback)

1. **Buttons are still wrong**

* There are still **green buttons** in places where they should be brand-styled.
* Primary button style must match the **Analyze My Website** gradient.
* Secondary button style must use the **secondary accent (blue/teal)**, not green.

2. **Glass look isn’t consistently applied**

* Some sections look properly “glass”, others still look flat.
* Glass should be applied via a shared set of utilities/tokens, not ad-hoc classes.

3. **Fix it buttons are not aligned**

* In the cards (Technical SEO / Core Web Vitals / Content Quality), the “Fix it” buttons are not the same size and aren’t aligned to a consistent baseline.
* All cards must be the same height and the CTA row must line up.

---

## DESIGN SYSTEM RULES (must enforce)

### A) Button hierarchy (hard rules)

1. **Primary CTA**

* Brand gradient (the same gradient used by “Analyze My Website”)
* Used for:

  * “Fix Everything Automatically”
  * “Analyze My Website” style CTAs

2. **Secondary CTA**

* Solid secondary accent (blue/teal), not green
* Used for:

  * “Generate My Site”
  * “Fix This” in card lists (if you want these to be secondary instead of primary)
  * Any section-level action that is not the main CTA

3. **Success / Completed**

* Green is ONLY allowed for:

  * “Completed”
  * “Healthy”
  * Checkmarks
* Green must not be used as a CTA style.

Implementation requirement:

* Create shared button variants in one place (do not hand-style buttons per section):

  * `Button variant="primaryGradient"`
  * `Button variant="secondaryAccent"`
  * `Button variant="outlineGlass"`

---

### B) Glass panels (hard rules)

All content containers on the report page must use a consistent “glass” base class:

* translucent background
* backdrop blur
* subtle border
* soft shadow
* consistent rounding

Implementation requirement:

* Define reusable class helpers (either in a `cn()` constants file or Tailwind component classes):

  * `glassPanel`
  * `glassPanelDark`
  * `glassCard`
  * `glassBorder`

Then apply those across:

* the “What We Checked” cards
* the category cards (Technical SEO / Core Web Vitals / Content Quality)
* the “One-Click Fix Engine” container and rows

No section should use plain white flat cards unless it’s intentionally the page background.

---

### C) Card CTA alignment

All “category cards” must have:

* consistent height
* consistent internal grid
* CTA pinned to the bottom-right
* button sizes consistent across cards

Implementation requirement:

* Use a card layout like:

  * header (icon + title)
  * body (description)
  * footer (CTA row)
* Make the card body `flex-1`
* Make footer `mt-auto` so all buttons align

Button sizing:

* Fixed height (e.g., h-10)
* Consistent padding
* Same radius
* Same font size

---

## CONCRETE TASKS (do these in order)

### 1) Find and remove all green CTA buttons on this page

* Search within the ScanPreview page components for:

  * `bg-green-`
  * `text-green-`
  * `emerald-` used on buttons
* Replace with button variants:

  * primaryGradient
  * secondaryAccent
    Green can remain for badges/pills indicating “Good”.

### 2) Implement shared Button variants

* Locate the shared Button component (shadcn/ui or local button).
* Add variants:

  * `primaryGradient` = matches Analyze My Website gradient exactly
  * `secondaryAccent` = blue/teal solid (the secondary accent Kevin referenced)
  * `glassOutline` = translucent + border for tertiary actions
* Update all buttons on this page to use variants, not raw Tailwind classes.

### 3) Normalize glass styles via shared constants

* Create a small design tokens file for this page (or global):

  * `client/src/styles/glass.ts` exporting class strings
* Ensure every panel/card uses these tokens.
* Confirm the “flat” sections become glassy like the best section.

### 4) Fix card layout + CTA alignment

For the “Technical SEO / Core Web Vitals / Content Quality” cards:

* Ensure cards are the same height:

  * use `h-full` + parent grid with `items-stretch`
* Use `flex flex-col` inside each card
* Put CTA in a footer with `mt-auto`
* Ensure all “Fix it” buttons:

  * same width OR at least same height
  * right-aligned
  * consistent spacing

### 5) Visual regression check

After changes:

* Primary CTA matches Analyze My Website gradient
* Secondary CTA uses the blue/teal accent consistently (no green)
* Category cards look equally glassy
* Fix it buttons align perfectly across cards
* Page feels cohesive: no “flat” outlier sections

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

* Zero green CTA buttons remain on the page (except explicitly “Completed”)
* All CTAs use shared button variants
* Glass styling is uniform across sections
* Category cards match each other and “Fix it” buttons align
* The page reads as one consistent design system, not mixed styles

---

Deliverables

* File paths changed
* Screenshot showing:

  * aligned Fix it buttons
  * primary gradient CTA
  * secondary blue/teal CTAs
  * consistent glass look across sections
