ADD NEW PAID CREW MEMBER: ATLAS (AI OPTIMIZATION) + FREE BASELINE AI READINESS

Context:
We are extending the Hermes “My Crew” system. We need to add a new AI Optimization capability that improves AI discoverability. This must be implemented as:
- A FREE baseline AI Readiness (always on, invisible)
- A PAID crew member called Atlas that unlocks advanced AI Optimization

Do NOT redesign the page. Do NOT change existing roles. This is an additive change.

────────────────────────
1) FREE BASELINE (ALWAYS ON)
────────────────────────
Implement a background capability called “Baseline AI Readiness”.

Rules:
- This is NOT a visible crew member.
- It runs automatically for all sites.
- It provides a basic AI Discoverability Score.

Baseline AI Readiness responsibilities:
- Ensure robots.txt does not block AI crawlers
- Generate basic llms.txt
- Add minimal structured data
- Normalize page titles/descriptions for AI parsing
- Compute ai_discoverability_score (0–100)

UI:
- Show “AI Readiness: Basic” in Mission Status (small text)
- Do NOT show a crew slot for baseline
- Do NOT allow enabling/disabling

────────────────────────
2) PAID CREW MEMBER: ATLAS
────────────────────────
Add a new crew member and role slot:

Crew Member:
- Name: Atlas
- Role label: AI Optimization
- Short label: AI
- Subtitle: Optimization
- Pricing: Paid add-on (do not hardcode price yet, but treat as paid)

Role slot behavior:
- Atlas appears as an EMPTY ROLE SLOT on the ship.
- Role label visible even when empty.
- Empty state shows:
  - Role icon (AI / circuit / brain glyph)
  - Info (“i”) indicator
  - Text: “Optimize for AI discovery”

When selected/enabled:
- Show Atlas avatar (atlas_transparent.png)
- Status badge: Active
- Gold outline like other active crew

Add Atlas to:
- roles staffed count
- operational percentage calculation
- crew modal (select / enable)

────────────────────────
3) ATLAS SERVICE (WORKER STUB)
────────────────────────
Implement Atlas as a standard Hermes agent/service.

Endpoints:
- GET /api/atlas/health
- POST /api/atlas/run
- GET /api/atlas/outputs/latest

Outputs:
- ai_discoverability_score (0–100)
- issues[] (AI discoverability problems)
- fixes[] (prioritized)
- files_to_add[] (e.g. llms.txt, schema)
- pages_to_update[]
- competitive_ai_gap[] (optional later)

Atlas runs continuously once enabled.

────────────────────────
4) SET BONUS: AI DISCOVERABILITY
────────────────────────
Add a new Set Bonus card:

Title:
AI Discoverability

Value Prop:
“Help AI assistants understand, trust, and recommend your site.”

Requirements (ordered):
1. Atlas (AI Optimization)
2. Socrates (Knowledge Base)
3. Scotty (Technical SEO)

Behavior:
- Show progress: X / 3 systems online
- If partial:
  - Show “Next to unlock: Atlas” (or Socrates/Scotty depending on state)
  - Button: “Select Atlas”
- Clicking Select:
  - Preview-select Atlas on the ship (no billing)
  - Update set bonus progress visually

When fully active:
- Badge: Active
- Gold highlight
- Unlock outcomes:
  - “AI-friendly content summaries”
  - “Entity-consistent site structure”
  - “Competitive AI discoverability advantage”

────────────────────────
5) SHIP LAYOUT UPDATE
────────────────────────
Add one additional ROLE SLOT on the ship for Atlas.

Rules:
- No overlap with existing roles
- Maintain minimum spacing:
  - 24px horizontal
  - 32px vertical
- Atlas slot should be mid-deck (near Technical SEO / Socrates)
- Ship remains vertically long and dominant

────────────────────────
6) ASSETS
────────────────────────
We will provide:
- atlas_transparent.png (transparent background, same style as other bots)

Ensure the ship background image (blank ship) includes an empty bay for Atlas.

────────────────────────
7) WHAT NOT TO CHANGE
────────────────────────
- Do NOT remove existing crew members
- Do NOT move Mission Status or below-the-fold sections
- Do NOT add pricing UI yet
- Do NOT redesign the ship structure

────────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
────────────────────────
- Baseline AI Readiness runs for all sites without user action
- Atlas appears as a paid, selectable crew member
- Atlas has a visible role slot on the ship
- AI Discoverability set bonus exists and works
- Selecting Atlas updates ship, progress, and set bonuses
- Operational % includes Atlas when enabled
