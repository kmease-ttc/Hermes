FIX REQUEST: The /crew page was created but it DID NOT add the Ship Canvas. We must implement the ship now.

Goal:
- Add the Ship Canvas as the primary hero element on the /crew page (right column above the fold).
- The ship must have distinct compartments/rooms (role slots) that can be clicked.
- Each room displays the correct crew avatar (from attached_assets/generated_images) in 3 states: Empty, Selected (preview), Enabled (active).
- Clicking a room opens the existing Role Drawer with that role selected.

Non-negotiable UI requirements:
1) Above-the-fold layout must be:
   - Left: Status + Next Recommended Crew Member card
   - Right: Ship Canvas (NOT a list, NOT a grid of cards — an actual ship-like compartmental UI)
2) The ship must be LIGHTER than background (dark theme), with GOLD + SILVER accents.
3) The ship must feel like compartments/rooms, not floating circles.

Implementation instructions (do this in code):
A) Create a ShipCanvas component:
   - File: components/crew/ShipCanvas.tsx (or equivalent)
   - Props:
     - enabledAgents: Set<string>
     - selectedAgents: Set<string> (preview-only local state)
     - onSlotClick(roleId: string): void
   - Render a ship container with fixed-position compartments.

B) Use a practical approach (no fancy SVG required):
   - Use a single rounded “ship body” container (div) with a lighter background and subtle panel lines.
   - Inside, place 10–11 “compartment” divs with absolute positioning.
   - Each compartment has:
     - role label (e.g. Technical, Competitive, Performance)
     - avatar image centered (transparent PNG)
     - state ring:
       - Empty: avatar opacity 0.2, dashed border, “Add” hover
       - Selected: opacity 0.55, badge “Selected”
       - Enabled: opacity 1.0, badge “Active”, subtle gold glow ring

C) Role slots (canonical IDs):
- captain
- socrates
- natasha
- scotty
- beacon
- lookout
- speedster
- sentinel
- hemingway
- draper
- popular

D) Map each slot to avatar files (use these exact filenames):
- captain_transparent.png
- socrates_transparent.png
- natasha_transparent.png
- scotty_transparent.png
- beacon_transparent.png
- lookout_transparent.png
- speedster_transparent.png
- sentinel_transparent.png
- hemingway_transparent.png
- draper_transparent.png
- popular_transparent.png

E) Compartment layout (simple fixed coordinates):
- Place captain top center
- Place natasha + scotty upper mid left/right
- Place beacon center
- Place lookout + speedster mid left/right
- Place sentinel + hemingway lower left/right
- Place draper + popular bottom left/right
- Keep spacing so compartments read as “rooms” on a ship body.

F) Wire it to the existing drawer:
- When a compartment is clicked, call onSlotClick(roleId)
- This should open the Role Drawer you already built, showing that role’s details.

G) Replace whatever placeholder is currently on the right side above-the-fold:
- If there is a list/grid/card there now, remove it and mount <ShipCanvas ... />.

Quality bar:
- If you cannot create a detailed ship illustration, still implement the ship body + compartments as a clean schematic.
- Do NOT skip the ship again. A schematic ship with compartments is acceptable for v1.

Acceptance criteria:
- /crew shows ship canvas on the right above-the-fold
- Compartments are clearly distinct rooms
- Clicking any room opens drawer for that role
- Empty/Selected/Enabled states render correctly using opacity + border + badge
- Uses the transparent PNG avatars from attached_assets/generated_images
